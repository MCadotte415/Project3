## Introduction

There are approximately 3.1 million dogs in shelters in the US with over 1.5 million cats and dogs being killed in these shelters. When it comes time to get your family's next best friend, adoption is always the best option. For this project, we are using the “Adoptable Dogs” dataset, which contains information on over 3,000 adoptable dogs across the United States.. The data includes information on things like the dogs location, breed and even if they are house-trained or not.
