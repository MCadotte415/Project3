This little long haired chihuahua perfection was a breeder surrendered.  Despite her sad past. She is as lovely as can be and ready for her forever home.  
She is good with dogs,  kids, and cats.  She is also comfortable in a crate ( aka crate-trained). She will need practice on a leash so that walks are fun and exciting! 
She will do best in a home with another dog to show her the ropes. She uses a doggie door, and will do well on potty pads once she understands. She is a happy little girl, but still shy around people and doesn't like to be held, but give her time and she will be the best little love bug ever!

Interested in becoming a forever home for Lady Bugette? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.

We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Lady Bugette.
We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Lady Bugette the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  
For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.

Thank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!"

This little guy just turned 6 in August and is neutered. He is the sweetest dog you'll ever meet, loves to cuddle + sit on your lap all day. He would be great with older kids (maybe over 9-10) but probably not young kids because he is a bit jumpy at sudden sounds and movements. He is not so happy around other dogs, so we would love for him to go to a home where he can have his human(s) all to himself. He is pad trained but also a great walker. He sometimes barks at dogs and people on his walks, but is pretty small and easy to handle. He sleeps through the night and his foster home says he is very housebroken. He likes to play with his squeaky toy sometimes but is not overly playful. The ideal applicant is someone who is home often and can give him all of the love and attention he deserves!

To learn more about Jimmy, please email us at clawsadopt@yahoo.com or fill out an application on our website www.clawsadopt.org. Thanks! A volunteer will get back to you soon."

Maggie is housebroken and friendly with other canines (we donât know about cats but thereâs a good possibility she would enjoy chasing them!).  Because she can be such a little spitfire, she will need to be properly introduced and supervised around young children and is better suited to a family who has already experienced the joys of raising a rambunctious pup.

She is cautious around new people and takes some time to build her trust and warm up.

I'm 75 lbs of PURE HUNK O' LOVE! I was given up by my owner due to NO TIME. I'm  super sweet and friendly but a bit of a \""bull in a china shop\"".. I'm a big goofy puppy and for a lughead,  I walk great on a leash... BUT if I see a squirrel I'm off to the races!! I'm a bit reactive to dogs on leash as I only ever knew one dog when I was younger. My owner introduced me to his neighbors big female black lab/pit X and we were BFFs.. but I was never socialized with other dogs because I was never walked.. just let out into a basement yard so as a result I'm a bit guarded on leash with other dogs in passing. I think I could be with another dog (preferably a female) as long as I was introduced properly and with an experienced handler. I seem to be fine with small dogs that are calm and not too hyper. I'm a bit too interested in cats so NO CATS for me. Because of my size and strength, it's best that I go with older kids ages 10 yrs+. Since I'm technically still a puppy,  I do need chew toys and the really tough ones as I'm good at destroying wimpy toys and balls in 2 minutes or less!  I'm super crate trained and good left home alone without any separation anxiety. I know basic commands and am an expert fetcher... but like I said I'm still young and need structured exercise, discipline and further maintenance training. I'm not hyper and have great medium energy. I would love someone/couple who KNOWS, UNDERSTANDS and APPRECIATES MY BREED and a big backyard to fetch to my hearts content.  I'm eager to please and quick to learn and if you stick with me... I'm going to be a SUPERSTAR of a DOG because I have such a SWEET temperament and  such a SILLY MUSHY disposition. If you want a big LUGHEAD LOVERBOY in your life .. come meet me today!

She is just finishing her heartworm treatment and is finally ready to find her forever home!

This lovely southern ladyâs name is Ava and she is a 2 year old female German Shepherd Boxer mix. We know this cause we had her DNA tested!! She is a little thing at only 30lbs but is just the sweetest pup you will ever meet.

Ava has had quite a rough start in life. She was a stray that had several litters of pups and relied on scraps from the local Sonic to feed herself. The world was really hard on her, and it showed. She is the sweetest girl but is still very shy. You can tell she has been through a lot in her short lifetime! Whoever adopts her needs to understand her need for patience. She has been in foster care for about 3 months now and it took her two to really get comfortable. Even now she if anyone new comes in and tries to pet her she hides in a corner and shakes. She will need a lot of socialization work and a family who will understand her personality given her history, and be patient with her.

Luckily, she decided to let rescuers finally catch her and she led them to her 10 puppies which she had tucked away in the woods under an old pile of tin. All the pups have since been adopted and now itâs Avaâs turn!

This sweet lady takes a while to warm up to people, so her new family will need to understand her shyness and have some patience with her. But once she warms up, sheâs a bundle of fun with the most adorable personality! She loves the collect things in her dog bed, belly rubs, and chasing tennis balls! She gets along great with other dogs and loves to play, but also takes some time to warm up. She is good with cats and chickens and is house trained.

Ava is still currently at our sister shelter in Louisiana and is part of our Pre-adoption program. If you are interested in adopting please email Southernpawsrescue@gmail.com."

Meet Charlie!  Charlie is a sweet, friendly, happy go lucky 12 week old Lab/German Shepherd mix puppy.  He came into rescue when he landed in a local shelter and no one came looking for him.

Charlie is a sweet boy.  He loves people, especially children, and gets along well with other dogs.  He is non-reactive to cats.  

Charlie loves to run and play, and is always into something.  He's a very busy boy; all puppy.  He's very food and toy motivated, and is very eager to please.  He would do well in a home with another dog(s) or as an only dog, where he'd get ALL the attention!  We think Charlie would excel in an obedience class!

As with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. 

Charlie's adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.

With our dogs, she is just fine.  She mingles in with no issues whatsoever.  She does like to chew a bone, has not shown interest in toys yet.  She simple loves to cuddle, be pet and loved on.  She is a doll.    

UPDATE: Sidney has no issues with our stairs and continues to be a sweet mush.

UPDATE:  UPDATE:  Sidney is a beautiful young  dog. She is gentle and kind. Gets along well with other dogs and is fine with cats.

This adorable baby arrived on September 7th weighing in at 12 pounds, she is 3 months of age.   She is fostered with her sibling, Dusky.  This typical puppy loves to play with people or with her sibling, she loves to have some time with toys too. Once play is over, she enjoys snuggle/lap time to soak up the love and attention.    All night, this angel slept through the night like a good girl!

Danae is a sweet girl who likes to explore - she loves to chase around the play yard with her sister with or without a toy involved.  Like her sister, she can be a bit shy at first but warms up to new friends quickly.  She was happy to see the fosters big dogs to come meet her - her tail was wagging throughout the entire meeting.

UPDATE:  Danae is a sweet girl, she likes to explore and had a great time on the walk. She wanted to explore and sniff around.  She grabbed a leaf on a bush as we walked by it âjust because!â She is doing well on a leash and is happy to meet new people, dogs whatever.  She is using pads to relieve herself when in her play yard.  She loves to play with people, other dogs, her sister or toys.  She is quiet overnight with her sister.

UPDATE:  Danae started out shy but came out of her shell nicely.  She is a confident, friendly girl.  She is wee-wee pad trained, and we are starting to work on housebreaking with her.  She is on the quiet side, when in crate or play yard alone, she protests a moment and then she settles down and entertains herself or takes a nap.  She recently met a lot of new people of all ages and was excellent with children, men and women alike.  She was interested in all the dogs around her, but was not afraid.  Danae is a lovely and intelligent dog who makes good eye contact and seems to want to please her foster mom.

Her mom, is also on our website, her name is Sidney."

Once we arrived to his foster home he met the other dogs that live in the house.  Everyone got along great!  He was so happy to have someone to play with.  Once it was time to come inside, he calmed down nicely.  He had no problems going into his crate for the night.  When Bandit goes for a walk, he is excited and pulls on the leash at first but then settles into the walk nicely after being corrected. (he does pull at first) He is housebroken and has not had any accidents in the house.  He is not into chasing a ball but has found his favorite squeaky toy that he carries around the house with him.  We are working on simple commands like sit and stay.  He just wants to please.  He does have puppy energy but once it is out of his system, he settles down nicely.  He does not bark often, even when the others in the home do.  He is a very happy dog! 


UPDATE: Bandit is the happiest dog and loves to be pet.  He loves nothing more than to curl up next to you and put his head in your lap so you can gently pet him.  First thing in the morning, I let him out into the back yard, and he checks everything out to make sure everything is good.  He follows me up to the bathroom and sits watching me get ready.  When I am not home, he stays in his crate.  I have no trouble getting him into it.  He likes it.  When I am home, he follows me around then finds a comfortable spot to lay down and take a nap.  He loves to go for walks.  He would make a great running partner should you wish to run with him.   A friend took him for a 5 min run and he was a pro.  Bandit is still accident free in the home and will walk to the back door when he needs to go out.  He still is not interested in playing fetch but loves to gather the sticks in the yard and bring them to me.  He is great with other dogs and my nephew who is 5 years of age.  My kids call him the happiest dog in the world!  He truly is a sweet young boy.  He is very smart so completing some training with him should be quite easy.

He weighs about 35 pounds, which means 35 pounds of entertainment, devotion, and energy. He inherited the best of both breeds - he is fun-loving like the shepherd and hard-working like the cattle dog and allllllllll herding dog because he is one smart cookie! Buzz is ready to go when you wake up and will greet you with his wiggly butt in the morning, and ready to go for a big long walk as soon as you get home in the afternoon. Wanna herd? Buzz is your guy. Wanna play ball? Buzz! Agility? Buzz again!

Buzz's ideal home is active and that is going to challenge his mind and body. He loves learning new things and is very treat and toy motivated. He's also going to need a job whether that be agility, dock diving, nose work, search and rescue or lure coursing - he'll happily try any sport so if you want to try them all then he is down for that. Buzz is learning to walk on leash and is about 90% potty-trained. He is crate-trained and sleeps in his cage at night. Buzz is a herding breed puppy and we are teaching him not to herd and nip. Because of this, a home without children is required. 

Buzz LOVES other dogs and is sometimes to much for some dogs. He would do well with a younger female or male that likes his rambunctious play style. He is learning how to initiate proper play and this can annoying for some older dogs or dogs that do not like a puppy that will try and herd and nip them to play.

TWO DELICIOUS DOODLE GIRLS ARE READY FOR THEIR HAPPY EVER AFTERS TOGETHER! 

EMMA & KODY'S STORY
Emma (Red) an incredibly sweet and affectionate 7 year old & Kody (chocolate) a shy and mellow 5.5 year old lover-girl, are 2 of 3 Australian Labradoodle girls who came to DRC through our friends and collegues at the Montclair Animal Shelter via the efforts of a good Samaritan. They have endured tragedy, loss and suffered severe neglect due to their former owner falling on hard times. The neglect was completely unintentional as these dogs were beloved family members.  

When they arrived at the shelter, the pups were filthy and their hair was matted and felted to the skin from lack of grooming. They were excessively thin and malnourished beneath their matted coats and loaded with fleas and intestinal parasites. 

Now that the girls are in foster care and we have had the opportunity to get to know them, we can report that in spite of all they have been through, these beautiful girls have settled in and are WONDERFUL, sweet, well-mannered, well-trained companions! It is obvious that they were well cared for until tragedy struck and they were clearly loved. Miss Emma and Miss Kody are extremely bonded and become deeply stressed crying for each other if separated. This has made it obvious to us that they must be placed into a home together. 

Miss Emma is the older and smaller one of the sisters. A glorious Red color, Emma is more slight of build than her sister. Emma is 7 and weighs approx. 42 lbs. Kody is larger at 50 lbs and currently weighs 55 lbs. They are both the perfect size, what we would call \""medium sized.â Skin and bones when they arrived, they have since gained much needed weight and have settled into their foster home beautifully.

Their foster mom reports:

â Both girls are surprisingly very social although Kody can be a little shy when first meeting new people. She is the younger and larger of the two, being 5.5 going on 6 years old and 50-55 lbs.  She is a beautiful rich chocolate color warms up instantaneously once comfortable, to become your bed buddy. She loves to \""talk\"" and bark and tell you all of her daily stories. Her favorite activity is tearing around the yard playing chase with my resident Doodles. She is the more energetic of the two. Emma who was skin and bones when she first arrived, has put on close to 10 lbs in a few shorts weeks with us and with consistent and nutritious meals. She is active but less energetic than her younger sister and is a total snuggle-bug who thinks sheâs a petite lap dog. She loves to curl up next to her person on the bed at night and be loved on.\"" 

\""We initially thought that Kody was the one who is in charge, but have since observed that itâs Miss Emma the little red spitfire that rules the roost! Both girls have had some issues with what I call \""mushy tushyâ as they have been acclimating to more nutritious food. We seem to have that under control now and they seem to absolutely LOVE their new food regimen.  They are both drop dead gorgeous pups with exceptional personalities and temperaments. Clearly, their former owner did an excellent job with these dogs as they were obviously very well loved. They are smart, loving, well socialized, and now after a couple of initial accidents, understandable considering they were living in garage, they have demonstrated their impeccable potty and social manors. They know basic commands, tend to stick close and get on famously with other dogs and cats. They ride beautifully in the car, are pretty good on leash and  are truly an absolute delight to have here. They will need a home with a large fenced yard, where they are permitted on furniture and with a person or family that are going to make them a priority and part of the family.  They are by far, a couple of the easiest foster pups Iâve ever had the pleasure of having in my home!\"" 

Emma and Kody will need to be adopted as a pair. They will need a patient, loving, dog/doodle savvy ADULT ONLY home where someone is around at least part of the day. They would do well just the two of them or with another resident dog or dogs  for companionship. They get along well with cats. We would like for them to have a large yard surrounded by a physical fence at least 5' in height.

Emma and Kody will be wonderful additions to the right home and family!

In most cases, a PHYSICAL FENCE IS REQUIRED in order to be considered for a DRC rescue doodle.

DRC Adoption donations typically range from: $300 - $600 and vary according to the age, health, temperament and location of each dog. Every doodle is an individual and every doodle has his/her own specific needs and requirements. Adopters are selected based on compatibility, NOT on a \""first come, first serve basis. At no time does DRC ever put the desires of applicants before or above the needs and requirements of rescue doodles in our program.

REMEMBER, we have our DOG WALK at WAWAYANDA ST PARK ON SEPT 15th (sunday) 11am-3pm-- Please come w/your dog to support us!

So back to RUBY: she's appr 5 y/o per our vet. She seems ok with some dogs, curious... Since we do not know her back story, we will adopt her to an adult family, 16+y/o - she seems house broken and very friendly, but a little shy at first, needs warming up... Otherwise we really love this gal!

Please call before bringing your dog for them to meet so we can be sure we have an available volunteer at the time of your visit to let the two dogs spent time together... YOU can come for your first visit without your dog to fill out the pre-adoption form and to spend as much time as you like with our dog yourself... and then for the 2nd visit, bring your dog. We do not adopt first come/ we always adopt to the best home for our animals. 

If you rent, bring proof (lease/contract) that you can have a dog- Also bring your Vet's information to put on the adoption form. Our adoption fees for dogs is always $100.00 per dog

Lincoln gets along well with other dogs and children over 12 years old (not younger). He also knows some commands. 

Lincoln has a lot of energy for an older dog so he probably would do well with a fenced-in yard.

As a rescue, we want to pair our adopter and dogs in the most suitable environment, because of Ellz's background, she would only do best in a home with another dog(s).  This means, we are only considering adoption applications, if she gets adopted into a home with another dog(s).



Want to provide a loving home for Ellz? Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

He is very active, energetic, and playful.  He loves to be around people and is very social.  During his evaluation, we discovered he has severe resource guarding with food and toys.  He will need  VERY EXPERIENCED OWNERS ONLY WHO WILL PROVIDE HIM TRAINING. Besides resource guarding training, he'll need all the basics: obedience/manners training, loose leash walking, continued positive and well-mannered socialization.  Please only inquire if you have experience with dogs with resource guarding or other serious behavior issues.  He will need continued training and patience to ensure the safety of Chase and his new family."

This 11-month-old pup was rescued from a life of abuse and neglect, but his rough start in life has not affected his sweet, sunny disposition. His foster home has been working hard on his potty training and basic obedience, and he is very eager to please and trainable, but he will need a home that is willing to continue teaching him how to be a Very Good Dog! 

Brady is housebroken, crate-trained, neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations. He loves being with dogs that are about his size, and says that big dogs with lots of energy scare him a little. He's great with kids, and he's currently learning not to jump on people when he's having too much fun, so he might not be a great fit for very small children or folks with mobility challenges. 

Brady is so sweet, affectionate, and trainable. We feel he will do best in a home with a canine playmate (he is currently fostered with two shih-tzus) and a human who understands his exuberant terrier personality. He has been indifferent to cats and bunnies that he's met so far, but we suggest a visit with your animals before making an adoption decision. 

Brady is an all-around AWESOME dog who is ready to find his forever home. Application, veterinary reference check, home visit, and adoption fee required. If you are interested in Brady, please fill out our application and we will contact you!"

 He's good with well behaved kids and a GREAT road trip companion.

Hi! My name is Veruca Salt, and I am a 7 year old pittie mix who weighs around 50 lbs. I may have a serious face, but trust me ... I am all ready to love you! :-)

Hehe ... my human friend describe me as a \""big baby\"" ... I guess because I love cuddling! I'm a mild-tempered gal who isn't really into toys or acting silly. I'd much rather hang out with you! I can be a little shy when I first meet new people, but I warm up quickly and would do well in just about any type of household, including one with kids. 

I love going out for my walks and can be pretty strong on my leash at times. My new family will need to continue to work with me and teach me how to walk politely. I am a great student, I promise!

Thanks for reading all about me. If you're looking for a gentle lady with a true heart of gold, I'm the pup for you. I can't wait to meet you!

Love, Veruca Salt xoxo

I became part of a family about 7 years ago. I loved them so much but I think something happened and it became too hard for them to take care of me. Luckily they loved me enough to make sure I find a new home to be a part of. So now I'm staying with this awesome family that has lots of dogs and teenagers to play with. I've picked one guy to be \""my guy\"". He's 19.. and I lay around with him ALL DAY! To be honest, I'm a little afraid I'm going to lose him too, so I stay attached to his side. I play with the other dogs sometimes, but I really feel happy when I'm with my special person. Don't get me wrong, the dogs are fine. And the other people in the house are great. But I'm kinda sad that I lost my other family. I would absolutely love to find a new forever home. I know I can love someone so much that they'll never let me leave. I'm not sure if I like cats since I've never met them. And I think I'd like kids as long as they're nice to me. I'm still a little confused but I know with time and patience I'll become the fun loving dog that I was before this craziness began. Please give me a chance. And in case I forgot to mention it, my foster family is the greatest!

Hunter is 7 year old hound mix. He is going through a hard time now and is very sad. He needs a forever family to help him get through this hard time in his life. Apply online or inquire about Hunter!

We werenât quite sure what was going on with her as she acted a little different than other dogs. After spending more time with her and getting her examined at the vet weâve come to the conclusion that she is most likely deaf. We donât know if thatâs causing her to be a little off because itâs happened recently or she may be a little bit senile as well? Weâre just not sure. She is a little jumpy when being touched but will let you pet her head and face. Sheâs good with other dogs and cats too. Sheâs not your average dog and she may not do the regular things that other dogs do but we still feel she deserves a happy and loving home where someone understands her and accepts her for who she is."

I am a playful and well behaved 8 month old, smart lil' dude!  I think I belong to the Whippet, maybe Greyhound family.  Needless to say, that makes me long legged, slim and oh so handsome.  Everyone tells me that.
    I can be shy at first when I meet new people, but I do warm up pretty quickly.  Once I know you, I will just adore you!  I am a fast learner too!  I know many commands and I keep learning more.  I am so smart!  I have fun going on walks, especially at the park.  Did I mention that I am a really good hiker?  Its fun!
    I have lots of canine buddies at my foster home and at my day care center, Happy Hounds.  I play well and share bones and toys.  My foster mom has taught me that is a good thing to do.  I may not be best in a home with cats, though.  
    I am looking for my forever home, one that will help me to keep developing and learning as I grow.  If you think I am perfect for you, I will think you are perfect for me too!

Love and Licks,
Jake

Meet Rufus!  Rufus is a sweet, bouncy, playful, 3 year old Jack Russell Terrier/Dachshund mix.  He was rescued from a local shelter when his time was up, and no one was interested in adopting him because he was suffering from heartworm disease.  So he came to stay with us, and has now been treated for heartworms and has a clean bill of health!

Rufus is a sweet, sweet boy.  He is happy and bouncy and high on life, like many terrier/terrier mix varieties of dog.  He loves to dart around the yard, and is very fast while doing it.  He can bounce 3 or so feet off the ground from a standing position.  He does know how to chill, but definitely needs an active family to stimulate him.  Hiking and/or jogging are 2 activities we think Rufus would excel at!

As with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. 

Rufus' adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.

Hope is a 4 month old Coonhound/Beagle mix from Sugarâs litter. All her litter mates were adopted last month, but we held Hope back due to her blindness. She's had a tough start to life, as she is blind in both eyes due to congenital glaucoma. However her glaucoma doesn't stop her, and she loves to play with both humans and other dogs. We feel it would be best for her to go to a family without young children (due to her blindness) and a family that is more laid-back. She would do great with another mellow dog in the house, but we are unsure about cats, as her foster family only has dogs. 
Hope is 90% pee-pad trained, but needs work on going outdoors. Being blind, she is afraid of what is outside the house, and needs to be shown everything is safe. Despite her lack of vision, Hope has been given a clean bill of health and is ready for a family of her own!!!

With time and patience she will show you what a smart, fun, loving goofball she really is. Apply online to meet her at adoptions on Saturday at Petsmart in Wayne!!"

Meet Midnight!  Midnight is a fun loving, beautiful girl. She is 7 months old.  She weighs 42lbs.  Midnight was adopted as a little puppy this spring from a local shelter.  When she got out and got hit by a car and broke her leg, the owners no longer wanted her and she went back to the shelter. They reached out to us to help her and we had to say YES!  Her leg healed up nicely and she has no residual effects from the fracture.

Midnight loves to play!  She is so full of life! She is active and loves attention. She would love to have a canine buddy to romp with.  She would also be great for an active family that will include her in all kinds of dog friendly adventures, like trips to the beach/lake or on hikes.  She rides great in the car as well, so taking her along will be easy peasy.  Midnight was interested in the cats she has met, but once they hissed at her she ran the other way.  Because of her activity level and enthusiasm, we recommend that Midnight go to a home with school age kids and above. She will jump up, but we are working on that.  We are also working on leash manners.  She keeps her kennel clean and doesn't have any accidents in it.  She is house trained as well, but as with all dogs going through transitions, she might have an accident while she learns your routine and gets settled in. She is very smart and would excel at doggy school.  Midnight is a wonderful young dog and promises to be a good girl her forever family.

As with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. 

Midnight's adoption fee is $475, which covers all her vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.

Hello! My name is Mariah Carey, and I am a two year old pittie mix who weighs around 45 lbs. I am super cute, wiggly, friendly, and a happy little bundle of joy. :-)

I am a playful, fun-loving gal who enjoys my walks, playing with my toys, and rolling on my back for belly rubs from my favorite people. I can be a silly girl -- I'm still young, after all! -- and when I'm excited I do some playful nibbling. I don't mean anything bad by it, and I correct really easily. I'm a total people pleaser!

Because of my higher energy level, I'd do best in a home with teenagers and adults. I'd especially love for my new pack to take me on lots of adventures, since it seems like I haven't been exposed to the world that much. I'm always eager to learn more, and with you as my teacher, the sky is the limit!

Do you have a doggie at home? I am dog friendly! When you visit me in the shelter, you might see that I'm a little stressed by my fellow canine companions. Please pay that no mind. Outside my cage, I really enjoy meeting new pups and am goofy and playful with my doggie friends. My dog-to-dog skills need some work, but if you have a patient pup with a similar energy level, we might be a good match. Please bring your pooch along with you when you come to visit me.

Thanks for reading all about me. When you meet me, you'll quickly discover why this little nugget with the gigantic heart -- and wiggly butt! -- has quickly become a volunteer and staff favorite. I can't wait to meet you!

Love, Mariah Carey xoxo

She came to us heavily pregnant from West Virginia. Her pups have all been adopted and now momma need a home!! She is a small terrier mix (15-20lbs) about 1-2 years old. She has terrier tendencies and because of this we think a home with older children would be best.

Here is what her foster has to say:
Lucy is lovable and cuddly and cute as the dickens. She likes to be around people, usually snuggled up next to them. She loves riding in the car and being outside. She likes to chase balls and other toys. A tennis ball is the perfect size for her. She loves to jump and can walk and hop on her hind legs.

Lucy chews paper and slippers, but not shoes. She is crate trained, but not totally house trained yet. She has to learn to tell you when she needs to go outside. She play nips at you to get your attention, and we are working to break her of this habit. She barks at people to get their attention so they will love her. She also barks at every dog and cat she sees on the street. Lucy does not like the cat in her foster home and would do best with more submissive dogs. She thinks she rules the roost. ??

If interested in Lucy, apply online!!!"

Our goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues.  Puppies are ready to join their fur-ever homes at 11 weeks old and will not be adopted in pairs. For puppies under six months old, the applicantâs ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.

Harley has a great smile and she is such a sweetheart! Harley loves playtime with her sisters. Harley is so sweet - she was the most timid of the three sisters but she is gaining confidence and becoming more outgoing every day. Harley and her sisters came into rescue from a puppy flea market. All of the girls came in extremely thin but they are well-fed now at their foster mom's house and learning that they will never go hungry again. Harley was the most shy of the sisters but she has come a long way and gets a lot of attention and affection from her foster mom and her children. She is such a gorgeous puppy and will be a beautiful girl when full-grown. Her mom was a great Pyrenees and Dad and Anatolian Shepherd. She is a beautiful mix of both of these breeds and we cannot wait till she finds a great family of her own. Harley would do great with another dog for a playmate in her new home.We are all so happy she is now in rescue and canât wait to see her get a great family of her own!"

He was fully matted and a big mess but heâs all cleaned up and happy now! His tail is always wagging. He is neutered, current on vaccines and housebroken. Heâs good with all people, other dogs and cats too! His eyes were in pretty poor shape when we got him so we are currently tending to his medical needs. It looks like his left eye may need to be removed and he may need to have daily drops in the right eye indefinitely.
UPDATE: Otisâs pre-surgery bloodwork came back pretty bad. He has kidney disease, heart disease and he was losing protein so he is not a good candidate for surgery. We fattened him up so heâs nice and strong and sturdy and as of now he is only on a probiotic thatâs sprinkled in his food. He shows no signs of his ailments, in fact, he seems like a healthy and happy little dog. We decided to leave him as he is and hope that someone finds it in their heart to adopt him, give him a good life and see him through till the end. We unfortunately cannot say how long that might be but we can say he will make someone very happy ?"

She wants to be around you and wants your love, but isn't pushy about it.  She has shown signs of mild-moderate resource guarding. Although she does eventually trade out with treats, she is reluctant to do so.  She will need continued training when it comes to resources.  When it comes to walking on leash, Indi gets a gold star.  She rarely pulls, and enjoys staying by your side.

She does have diminished vision, but you would never know!  It doesnât seem to affect her at all!  Because of this, it may be best for Pixie to be in a home with older, respectful children, that would not startle her if she doesnât see them coming.  Pixie gets along well with all the people she has met, children and adults and strangers, and will come running if you call her name.  She also gets along well with the other dogs in her foster homeâ¦she just sniffs and walks away.  Doesnât pay too much attention to them, but really loves the company of people.  She ignores the cat in her foster home too.  Pixie is house-trained and will bark when she needs go out, as well as pee-pad trained.  Pixieâs favorite things to do include going for walks, going for rides in the car, and snuggling with people on the couch.  She loves tummy rubs!  Pixie came to rescue very matted and needed her fur to be clipped down.  She was not a fan of being groomed and was very afraid of the clippers.  Because of this, she needed a mild sedative.  Her new family should be aware of this and willing to help her through her fear. 

Pixie is an absolutely darling little Peke mix that will be a great addition to your home and family. Her adoption fee is $390.  Please open your heart and your forever home to our little Pixie.

My name is Lt. Dan and I am a year old mixed breed dog. We think I might be an Australian Cattle Dog mix or something, but one thing is for sure: I'm 100% handsome! I'm even more handsome with three legs! Your eyes do not deceive you: I am tripawed and a lucky boy. I am awesome with other dogs but my foster mom says I'm not that great with cats because oh boy do I like to chase them. I'm pretty food motivated and will take all of the snacks you'll give me... but I need a new family to help me watch my figure because of my disability.

Truth be told, I did not have the best start in life. I was dumped on the side of a road where I searched for my family and had to fend for myself. While looking for my family I was hit by a car. I was scared and lonely and was hurt really bad. I was so scared of people and it took three big scary men to catch me. They brought me to a hospital where I met my foster mom. She gave me pain medication and advocated for me. This is where the amazing Mel said foster mom could bring me into the rescue and make me better. They amputated my leg and my foster mom slowly gained my trust as I healed. As you can imagine I am still very scared around new people and strangers. I need my new family to come meet me a few times before I can go home with them. It would also be great if my new family has worked with a fearful dog before. I am getting better with trusting my foster mom about strangers and ignoring them. I love playing with my foster brothers and sisters and can play all day. I have foster kitties in the house that I will chase if they run. I am going to go play with my foster siblings now and my foster mom will tell you more.

Lt. Dan is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and on flea, tick and heartworm prevention monthly. He LOVES playing with other dogs and gets along with dogs of all sizes. He can live with dog savvy cats. Lt. Dan is fearful of new people and his adopter with be required to come to New Jersey a few times to meet him and spend some time with him before he can go to his new home. His adopters will also need to have experience with fearful dogs and will need to work with a positive reinforcement trainer. Once he learns to trust you, Lt. Dan will cuddle with you all day if you let him. He is a medium energy dog who just wants to be with his person. He will gladly occupy you on a long walk or cuddle on the couch all day with you. Because he had his leg amputated his adopters will need to be vigilant about his diet, weight and keep him exercised. Lt. Dan has had a rough beginning but with love and dedication he can overcome his past and be a loving member of a family. Could that be you?

SOHO is a 501c3 public charity focusing on rescuing herding dogs in crisis on the East Coast. Your pets will need to be up to date on vaccinations and heartworm preventative in order to be considered for adoption. Lt. Dan does have some additional adoption requirements: his foster mom would like a potential adopter to come and visit Lt. Dan a few times before taking him home in order to help him bond to his new family. Please note that Lt. Dan is located in HIGHLAND LAKES, NEW JERSEY."

He greets you with a full body WIGGLE and he loves to Cuddle too!

He likes to please people and listens extremely well! He comes when called and if he gets a little bit rowdy during play he calms quickly when asked. He is extremely motivated by praise and is very smart! We think he may have some border collie in him! He does have energy and would love a forever home that could provide him with daily walks or runs or has a nice-sized yard for him to play. He is dog friendly but can be a bit exuberant so probably best with older kids and larger/medium size dogs. No cats please. He is adventurous, loves snacks and is treat motivated which means he'll be a star pupil for training! He loves car rides, taking walks, is very loyal, protective and loving. 

Jason is a young GSD/border collie mix (we think, but can't be sure!) and is neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccines. He is about a year old and weighs 75 lbs. He is located in Houston, TX and would come to his new home on professional transport. For an app please email info@joyrides.org"

Hi my name is Dora and I am here to say. 
If you would just adopt me, I would love you in many ways .

I would be the perfect company when you want to take a walk.
We can stroll, take in the view and I would listen when you talk.

Maybe we can share some secrets just between you and me .
it would make us feel closer , how wonderful that might be ...

I could be sitting by your side and gently chew a bone 
and you would never ever feel that you where left alone

Of course I'd like to cuddle and you can give me belly rubs ..
and I can keep you company when you try relaxing in the tub .

I can keep you laughing with my silly, playful ways. 
and it will ease the sadness if you happen to have bad days .

you can be my family, and have my devotion until the end.
And I will always be glad to say you were my very best friend.

Looking for Love 
Dora"

Meet Gunner!!  We have posted about him numerous times before and we wanted to give everyone an update on how he is doing.  Lovable, goofy, playful, fun, energetic, and an all around happy dog are some of the words that our volunteers use to describe this 2 Â½ year old outgoing Lab and Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix. Gunner is big in size and even bigger in heart as he loves everyone that he meets. When he greets people he will give you his paw and roll over for a belly rub.  

Gunner is spending quality time going for long walks and working on his training commands with our volunteers. As you can see from the pictures his absolute favorite thing to do is to run around and play in our fenced in area which helps him to burn off a lot of his energy.  If you have a fenced in yard then Gunner would be in heaven to be able to run freely to his heartâs content.

Gunner arrived at our shelter about a year ago and was adopted a few months after that.  Unfortunately he is now back in the shelter since his last home wasnât the right environment for him to excel. Gunner is a very energetic and strong willed dog so the best home for him would be with owners that know how to work with and train him and has had a dog like him before. We believe in order for Gunner to become the best dog that he can be that he needs to be the only animal in the home since he likes all of the focus to be on him.  We know that the right owners are out there for Gunner and we want to take the time to find the best home for him as he truly is special in every way!

Gunner knows commands like sit and stay and he will also give you his paw.  Whoever adopts him will need to put the time and effort in to continue training him and we know in return that you will be rewarded with a dog that will want to please you. Gunner also does very well on a leash but when he sees another dog he starts to pull as he wants to meet that dog.  Our volunteers are continuing to give him consistent training so he remains in a calm state when on his walks. 

Gunner is housebroken, neutered, and up to date on all of his vaccinations. 

If you are an active person that loves to go hiking, jogging, or do any other activity then Gunner is the perfect loyal canine companion to have by your side.

Gunner is currently waiting ever so patiently at the shelter for someone to come and adopt him and show him just how great life can be. Will you give Gunner the forever home that he truly deserves?

If youâre interested in meeting this handsome guy then send us a Facebook message, call us at 973-831-5555, or email us at triboroanimal@gmail.com.

Come meet Gunner and see why all of our volunteers love him so much.  We can promise that you will not be disappointed!

This handsome pittie mix boy is 7 - years young and is so happy and grateful he is getting his second chance!

Bear came to us from a neglect situation and every day that passes, it is so beautiful to see him blossom and love each and every person he meets. He LOVES hugs and belly rubs and he pays you back with his big goofy grin. He uses his big paws to hug you back because he is so appreciative of the kindness and love. 

Bear gets along well with people and other dogs. He is learning to be gentle and walk well on leash because no one ever taught him before. He knows his basic commands and can even play catch. He is a quick learner and a smart boy! 

Bear would love a family of his own to snuggle and love.
Are you the one that can show Bear what a real forever home is? 

Your first step for adoption is to complete our adoption application at www.apathwaytohope.org.  We will then screen your application through a vet reference check, phone interview (this is when you can ask all of your questions over the phone), reference checks (2) and a home visit.  Our adoption donation is $300 and includes spay/neuter, microchipping, vaccines and preventatives up to date per the dog's age, health check, fecal / deworming as needed and heartworm testing and treatment as needed.  More details will be provided if you are being considered for adoption.

Gilda will be at Petco Kinnelon weekends from 1-4 starting June 9, after which she will also be available at our Ringwood location.  You can visit her in Ringwood from 3-5 weekdays and 8-9 am and pm daily."

Do you jog, have a pool or camp/hike near mountain streams?  Have you been thinking you'd feel safer with a companion that can athletically keep up with your pace and a size and overall appearance that would make someone with questionable intentions think twice on a trail or overnight camping?  

Spirit, speed and protection are the descriptive qualities I'd assign to Blue.  Best suited to a stable, energetic lifestyle dynamic - truck or jeep a plus!  

Blue is between 3-4 years - maybe a little younger.  He's been brought up to date with PROFESSIONAL basic training, good manners, leash walking and learning what it means to be a good dog and family member.  

He's spent several weeks this summer perfecting his muscle tone by diving and swimming in the pool.  We play a game called RESCUE - I toss the decoy, he dives and brings it to shore with me attached to his life vest. 

He's smart.  He can look you right in the eye when you say LOOK and point at your eyes (my favorite).  He works hard for food.  Gets along with other friendly dogs.  He can get some impressive lift off those four paws - a huge plus for a serious Frisbee tosser.  

 Blue needs TRUSTWORTHY stable leadership and structure.  We've built the foundation for him and he's ready for the next rung on the ladder.  Call Aunt Mary 908-362-1333  or e:mail auntmarysdoghouse@yahoo.com if you think Blue could be a great fit to your active life style.

April is 5 years young, full of energy and is ready to start the new chapter in her life. She needs to be the only dog (for now) as she needs your undivided attention, guidance and structure so she can learn how to be a family pet she once was.

I'm 55 lbs of SILLY HAPPY GO LUCKY BOY.  I am affectionately named so because I have bent front legs and slightly bowed back legs and the vet says it could be due to being crated as a young puppy for months in a crate that was too small or it could be a genetic condition and I was not given proper nutrition so my bones didn't form properly. Either/or the vet feels that surgery would be too painful and risky at this point. It's ok, my bent legs give me character and a sweet goofy \""Charlie Chaplin\"" walk and I get along just fine. I love to run and play and when I run you can barely notice my bent legs. I'm super fun loving and sweet and friendly to all. I am good with other dogs but I am a little ackward in approach so I tend to scare small dogs a bit but I'm good with other playful young big dogs. I'm a little too interested in cats and will chase them. I think I would be best with older kids ages 10 yrs + and because of my legs it would be best for me to be in a home in the country with a grass yard so I can be on soft surfaces because of my legs. I am a very \""SPECIAL\"" boy in more ways than one and I will unleash my charm on you once you meet me.. so please come meet me today!

At nearly 2 1/2 years old, Daisy is a sweet, shy soul who needs a little time before she opens up and trusts those around her. Once she is comfortable, Daisy becomes the most affectionate, happy-to-please dog around. She is a low- to medium-energy girl who walks very well on a leash. While is not a high-energy pup, Daisy is still happy to participate in all types of active fun such as hiking, walking, running and playing fetch. Daisy is dog friendly and enjoys the companionship of good friend. She is anxious around cats and we would recommend she not be in a home with any feline friends. She also becomes anxious and nervous around young children, so we recommend her for a home with older children. Daisy is very well behaved inside and outside the home. She is crate trained, house trained and up-to-date on all of her vaccinations. Daisy really just needs a loving home that can provide her with the routine and dependability she needs to thrive. She is more than ready for her forever family to find her."

The family, sadly, was unable to keep him but did give us a lot of great information about him, and we are all hoping that someone will see him and give him the forever home he so deserves.
Some background info: Winslow, about 10 years old, was rescued when animal control from an inner city pound was called about a dog left abandoned in a garage.  He was with us for a long while before going to spend the summer with a family in NYC.  They found that the city's pace, though they reside in a quieter neighborhood, is probably too much for Winslow and he became very anxious.  
In the house, Winslow is very comfortable, very sweet, cuddly and affectionate.  He does have a hard time with people or dogs he does not know coming into the home. He enjoys retreating into his crate to just chill out or nap. He only chews his own toys, and never destroys anything in the home.  He doesnât always want to release his toys, so having an extra ball or toy to switch out is good, and we recommend an adult home.  
Winslow is a sweet, affectionate and loyal dog who would do well in a quiet home where he is the only pet. A fenced yard would be great to give him exercise space without having to deal with other dogs on walks, though he does well on leash now. He has the most endearing face and his coat is beautiful and soft.  This boy has waited a long time to find the right home -- please consider him!"

Vinny is NOT your typical easy  going sweet beagle.  I know the photo is misleading however he can be quite the charmer with MEN.  Vinny is a self-conscious type of dog and is very suspicious of human motives when approached.  We attribute this to unpleasant early life experiences.  Vinny will do well in a home with just one man or a couple with dog experience.  Although good a on leash we just don't trust his behavior if a child were to run up to him or a person wanting to prove all dogs love them bends over his head.  He'd be OK in a  fenced yard and walks taken where there is limited exposure to encountering others.  Nose to the ground in the country he's probably a great candidate as a hunting dog.  He's more of that type of beagle than a docile house pet.    His guesstimated age is about FIVE years of age and he was rescued from a Newark, NJ shelter. He weighs in the range of 25 pounds.   He enthusiastically runs to you when called,  sits politely for food, guarding a bone is another matter so no long lasting treats for Vinny.  He goes to his bed/crate when asked,  He opts to hide under a flannel blanket curled up so tight that you don't even know he's inside the blanket so of course he feels a little vulnerable when you wake him. He's a late sleeper and he grumbles when he doesn't want to get up but we all know someone like this! He's a very clean dog too that takes his business outdoors. Vinny likes car rides.   He's is OK with cats and great with other usually bigger dogs. Bottom line if you're a single male in a more suburban or country location, don't have kids; like to hike for long periods of time Vinny could really make a turn around  in his behavior.  I believe the key to his success is sufficient exercise to relieve his tension coupled with a protocol for rehabilitating his unwanted quirks.

She loves her caretakers at the kennel where she resides, and she leads a mellow life, surrounded by people who love her. But it's still a kennel.

Meet  Ruby!  
She is a sweet, active senior girl,  looking for her forever home. 

Ruby was taken to a vet in southern NJ, to be put to sleep, because her owner was no longer able to care for her. The wonderful vet explained to the owner that she felt Ruby had too much life ahead of her, and she was too healthy to be put to sleep. She suggested surrendering her to Rescue, they agreed, and so we brought her to Sherryâs Place Rescue.

Ruby has since been brought up to date on all of her vaccinations, had her blood work done, nails clipped, groomed, and gotten a dental, to get her ready for her new home.  She loves squeaky toys, car rides, walks, snuggles, lap time, and can kill a tennis ball in 3 minutes flat.  

She is a senior, and needs a bit of extra care, as do all seniors, so is looking for a home who understands that.  She gets along with other dogs, but would probably love to be an only dog, to get all of the attention she craves and deserves. 

We are not certain of her exact age, but whatever it is she does not act it!  The vet believes she is around 12. 

Ruby is 9.5 pounds, and her adoption fee is $295.

Ella is boisterous when playing with others and has an extreme penchant for squeaky toys. She gets distracted easily because she is so joyful, so she needs work with basic obedience. Ella is a VERY fun and fun-loving girl.

Aria is 7 years old and 7 pounds.  Having been with other dogs most of her life we are looking for a home with a small companion to share her life. While she loves humans sheâs used to other dogs and we think she would thrive in that environment.   She's also fine with cats and kids, respectful older kids please, because of her size.

Rocco our Rock Star needs a foster or adopter. He is a mature gentleman, with some arthritis that we are treating with meds, and nothing stops him from enjoying his walks, swimming in the lake and even some light running after a ball.
Our boy is 12 yr old, weighs about 70 lb and is healthy in all other ways. He believes in live life to the fullest, day by day. He asks so little from his people: a soft bed, a carpeted floor, good food, a good bone and belly rubs.. Rocco loves to be brushed and have his butt rubbed.
He used to be city dog with the hustle and bustle of the city. Presently he loves the suburbs, with walks in the woods, swimming the lakes, wading in the creeks, and laying in the sun. He loves car rides.
His owner died many years ago and he hasn't had a real home for a long time.
We are looking for a long term foster home, where he can live out his years with someone who he can bond with and love. WJVA will be responsible for him medically. We just need to find that home that wants a companion. A older adult home would be best. And even though he is good with most dogs, he would be best being the only dog. He loves to play still, but forgets his back legs are not as young as they used to be.
All of us in WJVA love our boy and want the best for him. He needs a little time to warm up, but food and a squeak ball makes him feel relaxed and he will be your friend.
He actually is good with most bigger dogs, but because he hasn't lived with another dog before we feel he would do best as the one and only.

Please if you would like to meet Rocco, please email: wjvolunteers@yahoo.com"

To maintain control of bladder stones, he does well with both canned and dry Royal Canin SO, including treats. Baby is very fond of his human mom who is unable to keep him any longer, and he will want to have that same loving attachment with his new adopter.

Baby is usually nice to people and other dogs, but may be inconsistent. An alpha personality, he barks at cats, birds, and squirrels--who doesn't!  Baby is well-behaved at the vet and is good friends with his local postman. His retired groomer loves him and even returns regularly to groom Baby as necessary.

I am a super sweet, loveable and CALM liver and white pointer. Iâm between 1-2 years old. Originally from Alabama, now in northern NY, I arrived in pretty rough shape, but thankfully my foster folks and the doggie doctors have helped to transform me.

Iâm really easy to live with because I love everyone â people especially, but also dogs and probably even cats. My foster folks tell me that Iâm the easiest foster theyâve ever had the pleasure of fostering. Iâm a happy girl, with a constantly wagging tail and a sweet, gentle and loyal disposition. All I need is a warm, comfortable dog bed, but I would much prefer to share your couch or your bed, if you will let me! I weigh just under 50 pounds, which is just the right size for snuggling. I definitely love cuddles and belly rubs. Being close to my beloved humans is my favorite thing. I could see myself being an excellent companion to a retiree or someone who works from home.

I am doing my best to be a polite houseguest and my folks report that I am exceptionally well behaved. The resident dogs have become fast friends. I know that the bathroom is outside and I have very tidy bathroom habits. I can be left alone in the house uncrated, although I will tolerate being crated if you insist. I walk wonderfully on leash at a heel. No pulling! I havenât made a peep since I arrived. I ride perfectly in the car. I give gentle kisses and take treats nicely. I donât go through the trash, counter surf, bark, or chew things that I should not. I am a Velcro dog and like to stick close to home, so I could adjust to apartment life or an unfenced yard easily.

You should know that I was found as a stray with a fractured pelvis and front leg, probably the result of getting hit by a car. These fractures are healed now and I get around just fine, including going up and down stairs, but overly boisterous little humans and dogs wonât be a great fit for me. I prefer a laid-back lifestyle that includes soft couches and cuddles instead of long runs or rigorous play sessions.

I am fully vaccinated, dewormed and heartworm negative. I have been spayed, microchipped, and put on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative.

Hi, Iâm Cuervo.

I am a typical, energetic young pointer pup. I am about 1 year old and weigh 47 pounds. I am very active and busy and want to play most of the time, but once Iâm tuckered out, I also have a sweet, loving side that likes to be loved and cuddled. I am very social and would definitely enjoy having at least one other active dog at home to play with. Itâs FUN! When I play, I am bouncy and a little boisterous and that isnât always appreciated by the older dogs in my foster home. Sometimes I donât recognize another older dogâs signals immediately, since Iâm still learning the ins and out of appropriate play, but I get it pretty quickly, and will happily back down if another dog wants the toy or doesnât want to play with me. I am happy go lucky and perfectly willing to go find some other toy or dog to play with!

I like balls and will chase them if you throw underhand and low to the ground. If you throw it overhand or up high, I canât figure out where the ball has gone and so I go find something else to do. I adore soft toys, and will work at them until I have removed the squeaker. Chew toys are a great delight, too. A friend gave me a buffalo horn chew toy, and I really like it. I love my toys, but Iâm not particularly possessive about them. If one of my foster sisters takes a toy I was playing with, I let her have it.

I am very smart, and I love to learn. I know Sit and Paw, and I am working on Stay and Come. Iâm mostly housebroken, but still need reminders. Frequent potty breaks will help me be successful. We are still working on crate training. I am willing to go into my crate on my own, but only if a treat goes in before me! Hey, Iâm no dummy! Iâve also learned how to use my voice to communicate when Iâm bored, lonely, or want to be where the action is, but I am learning that âEnoughâ means Iâm not supposed to do that. Outside of the crate, I donât bark much and I settle down in my crate at bedtime.

I LOVE going for a walk. My foster mom says that Iâm pretty good on the leash if she uses something she calls an Easy Walk Harness. It has the fastener for the leash in front instead of on my back. Itâs pretty comfy and I donât pull much. I like to see the squirrels, but I donât chase them. They donât look like they are big enough to play with me.
I donât currently live with any cats, but I got to meet one at a friendâs house. She was ok, and I was kind of interested in her, but she Yowled at me. I liked hanging out with the dogs more than hanging out with her.
The thing I want more than anything else is my own family to love me and snuggle me â I hope my family is active and will play with me! And I hope my family is reading this and knows that I am the Boy for them! Please hurry. I canât wait to tell you in person how much I already love you! I will melt in your arms if you give me love.

I will come neutered, microchipped, and fully vetted.

This beauty was found begging for food in the market place.  He would be kicked, screamed at, rocks thrown at him....all memories that still plague him.  If he reaches for the toy u are handing him, within seconds he physically cringes to the ground, waiting for the kick.  When he takes a treat from ur hand, he will instinctively cower....waiting for what comes next.  When he first arrived, whenever he become overwhelmed at the mere sight of a harness or being placed in a car to take a drive....he would defecate and urinate in sheer panic.  He feared everything around him.  Every single thing. But despite that - despite how scared he was - he showed nothing but gentle, submissive love.  Never a growl.  Never a snap.  Nothing.  Nothing but a certain look upon his face.  A combination of pleading....of worry....and of wanting.  

This boy's story isn't as simple as him boarding a plane and being placed in a foster home.  He had extra saviors that pitched in for him.  Unka had to be held at a different foster home so that he could receive his vet care before heading to his long term foster in CT.  But because of how terrified he was, he could not be taken to the vet.  Instead of his vet care and transport being done with days, it has taken 2 wks.  His initial fosters, Pat and David Laws, combined with the staff at East Oak Veterinary Hospital, were so patient with him - never judging him as he trembled at a threat they could not see, never growing frustrated when he would pancake to the ground and refused to walk. From that place of acceptance and love, his healing began. Now he is with his long term foster, Colleen A. Fisher, who has been simply amazing.  Knowing he was so scared....she has literally let Unka set the pace. No pressure, no expectations, no demands.  And he is doing just beautifully.

Unka is great with other dogs (he feels more comfortable if they are smaller than he is.  He ISN'T aggressive to bigger dogs at all!  It's a matter of who he feels more comfortable with).  He is a gentle, sweet, calm boy - and wants nothing to just pure his heart out to u.  He is great with kids - but remember, this is a dog that has come from hell.  Very loud, energetic, active households may be too much energy for him.  So we think a home with older kids with a lower energy would be perfect for him.

Adoption fee includes health exam, up to date vaccines, microchip, deworming, neuter, bloodwork, and 30 days of free pet health insurance. Applications can be found on our website www.RDRanimalrescue.org.

I'm still trying to get my girlish figure back and currently weigh around 36lbs; my foster mom says she thinks I will probably stay under 40lbs even though I do love to eat as the puppies took a lot out of me ... a perfect size for either a home or an apartment.  I'm understandably pretty shy when you first meet me but if you give me a little bit of time and some TLC, I am learning that not all people are bad and do enjoy getting some attention.

Please stop in and meet Rudy soon.  He would love to meet you."

ABOUT THE PAPILLON

Friendly, Alert, Happy

A tiny dog, measuring 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, you can still spot a Papillon a block away thanks to the large, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name (âpapillonâ is French for âbutterflyâ). Some Paps have erect ears; in others, known as the Phalene type, the ears are down. Paps are dainty and elegant, with a plumed tail, and a long, silky coat of several color combinations, the base color being white. More robust than they look, Paps are little dogs for all seasons and reasons. They thrive in warm or cool climates, in town or country, and are eager to join family fun. They are excellent agility dogs and are consistent winners at the sportâs highest levels; less ambitious owners can train them to do all kinds of tricks.

ABOUT THE DACHSHUND

Friendly, Curious, Spunky

The word âiconâ is terribly overworked, but the Dachshundâwith his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personalityâis truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired.

Dachshunds arenât built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise, these tireless hounds are game for anything. Smart and vigilant, with a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions of hearts the world over.

I traveled from Tijuana Mexico where I survived nearly 2 years fending for myself, oh a place here and there would give me a scrap or spend a bit patting me, BUT nothing like the 5* home that has beds, blankets, fresh water bowls and food ample enough for 100's of my friends in Mexico.

I love to play with other dogs and people!  Haven't met a cat, so don't quote me that I would know how to be or what to do!  Kids are fun...

Your country is amazing!  I look forward to spending everyday with you, exploring on walks or just chilling out listening to you talk...ya know it's a different language here!  I so badly want best friends...to do stuff with and show how thankful I am to now be an American canine!  I promise to give you all kinds of kisses and smiles!

I originally come from California, but Iâm looking forward to my first Pacific Northwest winter! Foster mom says Iâll need a sweater to keep warm. I am an older gal, but I donât let that slow me down one bit. My foster mom has me up to three miles at a time, and she says that my average pace of 9 minutes a mile is pretty good! I walk with my foster mom and PRO alum Andrew every day, and still have energy left to play fetch. I am a âpocket pointerâ which means Iâm very small. I weigh in at a dainty 32 pounds. My foster mom says that I am âthe best of both worldsâ because I act like a big dog, but take up half the space! Foster mom says that I am making fantastic progress in every way, and she tells me sheâs proud of me every day!

 Lilly is a ball of energy, and a ray of sunshine. She is very playful, and loves to chew up rubber balls and spit out the remnants. She also likes sitting in the backyard looking at any little wild things that may cross her path. She has a strong prey drive, so sheâs kept leashed or tethered, but she doesnât mind that one bit. She is very strong, and loves walks and runs. Weâve got her up to three fast miles per run, and she could walk all day if you wanted to take her along! She is learning leash manners very quickly and responds well to treats. She is great in the house, and can be left unattended with no accidents or incidents, for the most part. Thunder, fireworks, and other unexplained loud booms to scare her and she can be reactive, but those issues are often few and far between. She is choosy about giving cuddles, but when sheâs in the mood, sheâs a great lap dog. She has been a true treat to have around. She is great with other dogs, very respectful of cats, and doesnât have a mean bone in her little body. She would be a great companion for someone who likes adventures as much as movie nights in, and she would go anywhere with anyone as long as she got a puppuccino for the ride!

Mannio is looking for a new family who has the time and knowledge of what dogs need from their human owners.  He is a great dog who has been well loved, but also needs structure, guidance, and follow through from his humans!  He is about 50 pounds. 

Breed and size is frequently a guess and can not be guaranteed. ARF dogs/pups are fostered at a private residence, we do not have a free standing shelter. ARF pups are all spayed/neutered, microchipped, current on vaccinations, and treated for internal and external parasites. They are fostered on a lovely farm where they run and play with other dogs, cats, horses, and barnyard fowl.  

E-mail ARFofMercer@gmail.com for an adoption application or with any questions. Once your adoption application is approved, you will be invited to meet our dogs/puppies. Our adoption fee includes 30 days of complimentary medical insurance for your new ARF pup.

Hi there, my name is Georgie!  I am a mixed breed \""pitbull\"" type pup of 7 months old.  I am house, crate and leash trained!  I love when my foster momma has my one on one training...we have done so much together to ensure I be a good boy in my forever home.  Things like Sit, Paw, Down, Wait and Come are the things we work on that she says I SO smart!!

I love hikes, other dogs, toys and just being 50 pound of flahhhhhhhhh on my doggy bed snoozing away!  I should have a home with kids that are taller than me as I still a puppy in my brain and can be a bit clumsy at times...and since I love everyone I would never want to rumble past a tiny tot and knock em' over.  

Why pick me out of the many pups like me?  Because my foster momma has worked really hard to ensure I a good boy at home and in public...plus just look at me...I am pretty sure I am the most handsome dude in the market for a home to share my love, fun and silly kisses!

Greetings!  I am Oscar a pure bred Yorkie...and just a ham!  With age comes aging and my sight is not good...BUT it doesn't stop me from loving my people and other dogs.

I love to go for walks, my foster mom will tell you this is just about my favorite thing net to being in her lap!  NO I do not swim...when it's hot foster momma takes me in the pool to cool off..it makes her happy so I allow her to snuggle me in the pool.  Guy has to do what a guy has to do!!

So along with limited eye sight I take a pill twice a day for my thyroid, nothing that is gonna break the bank...and I take it in my food with no fussing!

When foster momma is out, I am snug as a bug in my crate...she has me all set up with comfy everything!

SO just because I might be in my golden years and need a little pill twice per day, I personally think I am the best choice for your lap buddy!  I would really love to have an adopter that is pretty much like me ~ stay at home, lounge around the pool, go for an even stroll and snuggle on the couch for TV watching or reading a book!  Low key but still seeking that little adventure to keep the pep in the step! 

Oh an a final YAY for me...look how well groomed I am!  I like to be groomed...dogs now a days just don't realize how important it is to the ladies...to keep clean and neat looking :)"

Heâs being fostered in a home with 2 other senior dogs and a cat. Cap does great with the indoor cat. He tends to try to go after outdoor cats though. He gets along great with both of the other dogs in his foster home. 

Cap loves other dogs & does great with people as well. 

Capâs main quality is his happiness. He is a very happy dog. Everything makes his tail thump. His favorite thing in the world is meal time, followed by any time he gets to go outside. 

Captain does pretty decent on the leash during the daytime (when itâs actually light out) but pulls more when itâs dark outside. This is being worked on. 

Captain has osteoarthritis in his left elbow & degenerative joint disease (arthritis) in his hips. He loves to be active, but hobbles when he walks. He loves to go to the dog park & mingle with the other dogs. Stairs are a bit of a challenge for him, but with just a tiny bit of help, he can navigate them just fine. Heâs also been to the river & loves it!! 

Cap also does pretty good in the shower. He doesnât fight the shower at all. He sits there like a very good boy!!

I grew up living in a home in North Carolina but after one of my people passed away the other got really sick and could no longer care for me. I was dropped off at a crowded shelter in the mountains of North Carolina. I wasnât really a big fan of being in the shelter and that is when Pointer Rescue Org showed up and I left with my foster parents. I had a long road trip from North Carolina to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where Iâm now learning about lots of new things and am excited to find my new forever home. I am a very happy girl that LOVES to be around people and snuggle them on the couch. Every person I have seen I have wanted to meet. The same goes for dogs of all sizes. I enjoy soft, comfortable dog beds where I can get some sun but donât really like laying outside in the hot sun. Iâm not too sure about a lot of dog toys but I really like the soft, fuzzy ones that I can chew on. I get along with the other dog in the house but Iâm not a big fan of playing rough. Just laying around and being close to each other is ok with me. My foster parents tell me I walk well on a leash and donât pull and if I do I know to slow down to let them catch up. I know how to sit, especially if you have some yummy treats for me and will come when called. I LOVE Food and Treats and love to be in the kitchen anytime there is food being cooked. I was told Iâm not the best sous chef but Iâm probably the cutest one. I do like to check out whatâs on the kitchen counter but if you tell me Off I will sadly get off the counter. I enjoy going for walks and hiking but so far I donât like going into any water but I do enjoy a good mud bath. In my dream home I would be the only dog or have a brother or sister that is just as relaxed as me. Iâm a good sleeper and will gladly sleep all night in my kennel unless there is a thunder storm. Iâm not sure about those and if we have one I like to be under the covers in bed with my foster family. If you are looking for a relaxed, sweet southern girl, look no further!

Lil is a white English Pointer with some tan spots. She is around 6-7 years old, up to date on all of her shots (none due until July of 2020), spayed, microchipped, and tested negative for heartworms. She is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative and has been strategically dewormed. She does well with ear cleanings and brushing but needs some coaxing to get a bath and would do best with a groomer or vet trimming her nails.

My wish list includes a fenced yard, maybe a canine playmate and a family who understands I still have some \""puppy\"" behaviors and energy. 
I will need some continued guidance on house training as I adjust to a new home.
 And I will be honest, I really don't like being crated. I do get to sleep on the bed at night and am very quiet and behaved. Phoenix is bird crazy and likely has a high prey drive. She is friendly to other playful dogs, has a sweet loving personality with her humans. Small children in a home may not be ideal since she moves quickly and may knock them down.
This young girl is spayed, heartworm negative  current on her vaccines and preventions.
Her foster mom would love to talk more about Phoenix to approved applicants.

Needs Time

Jack is a three year old brindle male. He ran 69 races at Tri-State Kennel Club. While he was at the track, he slipped his collar and ran away. The trainers set up a search and were able to find him. Now he is looking for a home that will take their time with him and help him settle into his new surroundings. He has tested older kid, cat and other breed friendly. Jack is a sweet boy. Once he gets used to you and understands what you expect of him, he becomes very attached to you. He doesn't like loud noises, so city life is not for him. He enjoys being with the other greyhounds in his playgroup. He gravitates more towards the mid-pack dogs and avoids the more alpha dogs. If another greyhound starts to pick with him, he will walk away and keep to himself. He will join in with the daily zoomies, but we have not noticed him initiating them or doing them on his own. He has zero interest in toys. You can squeak a toy all day and he doesn't even look at you. If you throw a toy for him, he will run the other way. Due to his timid nature and need for a quiet environment, we will only place him with older kids (12+). We believe that he would do best with another dog, not necessarily a greyhound, in his home to help him with his inhibitions and be a dog. He doesn't mind going for a walk, but a loud noise or real sudden movement makes him stop. He can be encouraged to finish the walk. His forever home should have a fenced in backyard so he can relieve himself without having to be leash walked. He enjoys getting a treat and he does take them gently from your hand. Jack would make a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

She is much more interested in playing with toys and racing around her own backyard. She has tested older kid and other large breed friendly, however she is not cat or small animal safe. Valerie is young in age and in her mind. She loves getting your attention and will immediately roll over so you can give her belly rubs. When you stop rubbing, she will take her paw and pull your hand back towards her. She can never get enough. She loves being out with the other greyhounds in her playgroup. She is definitely the initiator of the daily zoomies and she does them on her own. She loves the squeaky toys the most, but any toy will do. If another greyhound wants the toy that she has, she will snatch it up and run away with it. She will sometimes run circles around them, toy in her mouth, and play bowing at them. Due to her playful nature, we will only place her with older kids (10+). We believe that she would do best with another dog in her home, not necessarily a greyhound, to play with and enjoy. She likes to go out for walks, but she needs some practice. She will cross right in front of the walker or suddenly stop. She enjoys getting treats and she does take them nicely from your hand, but she would rather have some belly rubs. Valerie would make a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

She doesn't need another greyhound in the Fun Run to help keep her occupied. She enjoys playing with the toys, even the ones that do not squeak. If you throw her a toy she will run over to it, pick it up and run passed you repeatedly. She likes to tease you, pretending that she will give it to you. Once she is done playing, she is all about the volunteer and getting some affection. She will even sit next to you as you pet her. Due to her age and playful nature, we will only place her with older kids (10+). She loves to go out for walks, but she could use some practice walking nicely on a leash.

When your application is received we process by reviewing all references and then setting up your conference or meeting with the foster family after those references have been checked. Because our foster families volunteer to open their hearts and homes to our rescues, we try to lessen the amount of interference with their lives by only allowing pre-approved adopters to meet the dog and/or call the foster family to ask questions about the dog. The pre-approval process does not obligate you and would NOT require a home visit until you have spoken with or met with the foster family to be sure the dog is right for you. Once that occurs and you are committed to adopting our rescue, then we will schedule your home visit. 

PLEASE NOTE: SOME DOGS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR A MEET AND GREET. Because we are a foster based rescue, our rescues are transported to our foster families AFTER they have been vetted and are cleared for transport medically. Although our company has headquarters in New Jersey and our second location in Mass, where they end up being fostered depends on which foster is available at that time (our pet finder site only allows us to post in New Jersey or Mass, not where dogs are fostered). Our foster team members are located from North Carolina all the way to Southern Maine. IF THEY ARE BEING FOSTERED OUTSIDE OF THE AREA THAT YOU COULD EASILY TRAVEL TO, we arrange for you to speak with the foster to determine if the dog is what you are expecting. So, if the dogs are not being fostered close enough to visit prior to adoption and this is not acceptable to you, please do not fill out an application. 

In many cases our rescues are adopted directly from their vetting and quarantine and do not even get to foster. Many families are comfortable for a direct adoption, especially with puppies or with the evaluation provided by our references and our rescue trainer. In this case they are transported to the adopter and our adoption contract provides for a thirty day refund of your adoption fee for any reason. The dog is returned to us if they are not working and it cannot be resolved to yours and to our satisfaction. 

From this point, with all information on the application being acceptable and the home visit satisfactory, the applicant is approved and the adoption takes place. Your contracts are emailed and your adoption fee will be $350 (that includes all medical and transport fees). Once contracts are signed and your adoption fee paid, arrangements are made to transport the dog to his/her home, whether it be from a foster or from our vet clinic. 

Beyond the thirty day refund policy in our adoption contract, Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. offers a lifetime guarantee on all of its animals. If for any reason an owner needs to return the adopted dog, Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. always welcomes the pooch's return and your contract will provide for this"

Our rescue had a home for one of the puppies, but our policy is to never leave any pups in a litter behind.....so our family grew by four and we absolutely adore these pups.

No health issues and no bad habits that I've seen so far. The shelter paperwork said no small dogs or cats with her. She hurt a small dog at her home about a year ago. The owner said it was an accident. She is curious about my cat but nothing negative so far. The cat has been keeping his distance from her. She is quiet, I've only heard her bark once at the neighbors dog. She's a laid back and loving girl to a fault. She loves people, she will lick your hand and roll over for a belly rub every chance she gets!. I dont have any info as far as children. She is very fearful of men and we're helping her through that now. She walks well on the leash. She gets along great with all our dogs here. She has basic training, house trained and is crate trained. I've let her have free run of the house all day and night and she hasn't made any mistakes. No chewing, no potty mistakes, nothing! I feed her in her crate. When taking a treat from your hand she is oh so careful like a whisper. She absolutely loves to sleep with her person. She stays in her little spot and doesn't crowd. But when you wake up, you can bet she will crawl up to you for a belly rub!

You can learn more about her from her foster family on her own Facebook page at:

OUR ADOPTION PROCESS:
Our online application is available under the link located at: 
http://www.diamonddogsrescueinc.com/online-adoption-application.html
Please do not fill out on a mobile application as it does not allow form to be submitted.  It should be filled out and submitted on a computer.
 
When your application is received we process by reviewing all references and then setting up your conference or meeting with the foster family after those references have been checked.    Because our foster families volunteer to open their hearts and homes to our rescues, we try to lessen the amount of interference with their lives by only allowing pre-approved adopters to meet the dog and/or call the foster family to ask questions about the dog.   The pre-approval process does not obligate you and would NOT require a home visit until you have spoken with or met with the foster family to be sure the dog is right for you.   Once that occurs and you are committed to adopting our rescue, then we will schedule your home visit.  

PLEASE NOTE:  SOME DOGS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR A MEET AND GREET.  Because we are a foster based rescue, our rescues are transported to our foster families AFTER they have been vetted and are cleared for transport medically.  Although our company has headquarters in New Jersey and our second location in Mass, where they end up being fostered depends on which foster is available at that time (our pet finder site only allows us to post in New Jersey or Mass, not where dogs are fostered).   Our foster team members are located from North Carolina all the way to Southern Maine.  IF THEY ARE BEING FOSTERED OUTSIDE OF THE AREA THAT YOU COULD EASILY TRAVEL TO, we arrange for you to speak with the foster to determine if the dog is what you are expecting.  So, if the dogs are not being fostered close enough to visit prior to adoption and this is not acceptable to you, please do not fill out an application. 

In many cases our rescues are adopted directly from their vetting and quarantine and do not even get to foster.  Many families are comfortable for a direct adoption, especially with puppies or with the evaluation provided by our references and our rescue trainer.   In this case they are transported to the adopter and our adoption contract provides for a thirty day refund of your adoption fee for any reason.   The dog is returned to us if they are not working and it cannot be resolved to yours and to our satisfaction. 

From this point, with all information on the application being acceptable and the home visit satisfactory,  the applicant is approved and the adoption takes place.  Your contracts are emailed and your adoption fee will be $350 (that includes all medical and transport fees).   Once contracts are signed and your adoption fee paid,  arrangements are made to transport the dog to his/her home, whether it be from a foster or from our vet clinic.  

Beyond the thirty day refund policy in our adoption contract, Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. offers a lifetime guarantee on all of its animals.  If for any reason an owner needs to return the adopted dog, Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. always welcomes the pooch's return and your contract will provide for this.

Race Name: Canaan Raisen
DOB: February 7, 2017
Color/Sex: Black Male
Weight: 69lbs.

Good With Kids, Cats and Other Breeds

Greyt Boy

Raisen is a two year old black male. He ran 29 races at Daytona Beach and Orange Park Kennel Club. He is interested in an early retirement so he can get maximum couch potato time. He has tested kid, cat and other breed friendly. Raisen is a very sweet and engaging boy. He loves to be around people and he prefers your attention to any toy or greyhound in his playgroup. He will come up to you and nudge your arm to get your attention. He isn't pushy about it and doesn't try to move other greyhounds to get to you. He will wait patiently. He enjoys the company of other greyhounds in his playgroup. He loves to join in on the daily zoomies and he will do them on his own too. He has shown some interest in toys, the ones that squeak, but he hasn't really started to play yet. If you throw a toy for him, he will run up to it, sniff it and walk away. He does enjoy lounging in the baby pools. He loves to go out for a walk. Once he gets over the initial excitement of seeing a leash in your hand and that you are coming for him, he settles in and walks nicely on a leash. If you stop during your walk for any amount of time, he will lean on you until you start walking again. He knows that when he returns from his walk, he is supposed to get a treat. He will watch you until you bring him one. He does take the treat gently from your hand. Raisen would make a greyt first greyhound or a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

He enjoys being rubbed and likes to have a window to look out of. Heâs very submissive and enjoys doing whatâs asked of him especially when thereâs a treat. Logan has an auto immune disease called VKH syndrome ( https://www.marvistavet.com/vkh-syndrome.pml ) which affects the pigment of his skin and without immediate treatment can have a long term effect on the eyes and possible blindness. In terms of medical treatment,  He is currently on a steroid (prednisone) which helps suppress his immune system to stop it from attacking itself. Also on eye medication (prednisone, timolol, and dorzolamide). Pricewise the medications themselves are not costly. As of now, I havenât spent more than $70 dollars for his medications. The more costly things Iâve noticed was the actual exam fee. He has dog insurance which covers 90% of his medical expenses excluding the exam fee. Logan knows the sit, stay, lay commands. I'll ask him if he wants water or does he have to use the bathroom and heâll respond with a whine if he does. Same for food. The type of home I think that would be best suited for him is one where he can both be active and have some time to relax and receive a lot of love and just remain social, whether itâs with kids, other dogs, etc. He is house broken so he doesnât need to be crated.  

This Akita is located in Rochester, NY. If you're interested in him, please go to our website and fill out a online adoption application and we will get back to you shortly."

Fast forward to a ground transport from GA to South Florida, where our great transporters remarked on how sweet she is and how she looks for affection. Rogue came with some red areas on her skin from being loaded with fleas, and we can tell she has been a mama a few times.

Rogue is a calm girl, who politely asks for cuddles. She tries to be sneaky and counter surf when she thinks the coast is clear, but responds quickly to verbal correction and walks out of the kitchen. Rogue LOVES squeaky toys! She is good on a leash and loves companionship. Rogue is good with dogs and cats, and in general is a very easy going gal!

No Cats or Small Animals

Brood Momma!

Happy is a six year old brindle female. She ran 99 races at Tri-State Kennel Club. Once she was finished with her racing career, she returned to her racing owners for her second career as a brood mom. She had six offspring in one litter. We had the pleasure of having two of them, Mouthy and Kankles, join Our Village. Now she is looking for a forever family that will treat her like a puppy and give her plenty of love and toys. She has tested older kid and other large breed friendly, however she is not cat or small animal safe. Happy is the perfect name for this dog. She is always happy and her demeanor is infectious. She loves people and greets everyone with a big smile and a helicopter tail. She loves being outside with the other greyhounds in her playgroup. She is definitely an initiator of the daily zoomies and play. She will engage with any greyhound from the most outgoing to the shyest. She is a stuffy stealer and likes to keep them all for her. She is never nasty about it and doesn't push anyone around. She will play with her toy until the other greyhound gets board, then she will take the other toy. She will also play and do her daily zoomies on her own. Due to her playful nature, we will only place her with older kids (10+). She loves to go out for walks and once she settles in, she walks nicely on a leash. She loves getting treats and will take them gently from our hands. Happy would make a greyt first greyhound or a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

Super sweet, loving and affectionate, Pipa is a fantastic canine!! Her foster mom just loves her! She loves having her ears and belly rubbed. She loves the snow! SHE LOVES PLAYING FETCH!

Pipa is 100% house trained and is fine in the crate when you are out of the home, or a penned area. She takes treats very gently from your hand and loves her antlers, bones and kongs with peanut butter! She loves her walks and is really wonderful on the leash. She LOVES her daily walks and is great on the leash. Back in the home, she loves to cuddle and is a true couch potato!

Pipa will thrive in a home that is loving, caring and committed to keeping her safe and happy forever! She will also love with a guardian or family who takes her for her daily walks. She would do fine as solo dog or with a calm, balanced canine companion (intros always needed). Older kids are best or adult only home. 

Pipa is about 31/2 years old and weighs about 70 lbs. She is utd on shots, spayed and microchipped.

She came to us with five adorable pups who are also available for adoption.  She's a little reserved around new people but is very affectionate with people she knows.

She's a little powerhouse, like all herding dogs she got plenty of energy.  FLORA would be very happy in a home with a person or family that enjoys an active lifestyle; camping, hiking, frisbee, walks, day-trips, picknicks and things of that nature.  She's a true companion dog, and is game for anything!

A LITTLE ABOUT THE CATTLE DOG

Alert, Curious, Pleasant

\""The compact but muscular Australian Cattle Dog, also called Blue Heeler or Queensland Heeler, is related to Australiaâs famous wild dog, the Dingo. These resilient herders are intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners.

Standing between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns blue-gray or red. Both coat varieties feature distinctive mottling or specking patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at hunting, chasing, and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners.

ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, ever alert, and wary of strangers. If an ACD isnât challenged, he easily becomes bored and gets into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with their dog in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep him mentally and physically fit.\""  ~AKC

Race Name: Kl's Arrow
DOB: November 27, 2017
Color/Sex: Red Brindle Male
Weight: 59lbs.

Good With Older Kids, Cats and Other Breeds

Sweet Little Boy

Arrow is a twenty month old red brindle male. He ran 5 schooling races at Tri-State Kennel Club. Now this little man is looking for big love from an adoptive family of his very own. He has tested older kid, cat and other breed friendly. Arrow can be cautious when you first meet him and in new environments. When he first meets you, he watches you and what you are doing very intensely. It doesn't take him long to warm up to you and he is very sweet. He loves being out with the other greyhounds in his playgroup and he is a different more confident dog in a pack. He will join in on the daily zoomies with them, but he does not initiate them or do them on his own yet. He has not started to play with toys and he has zero interest in the squeaky noise. He does love to dig in the dirt, find a cool comfy spot and do what a retired greyhound does best...rest and sleep. It was impossible to get a picture of him standing up. Every time we would get him up, he would walk away and find another comfy spot. Due to his very mellow nature and need for time to settle in, we will only place him with older kids (10+). We also believe that he would do best in a home with another dog, not necessarily a greyhound, to have a BFF to play and hand around. He enjoys going for walks with someone he knows or with other dogs, and he walks nicely on a leash. He does love getting treats, but he has not started to take them from our hands. He will push it with his nose until you put it down for him. Arrow would make a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

Race Name: AB Sanction
DOB: April 17, 2016

Weight: 75lbs.

Good With Kids and Other Large Breeds
No Cats or Small Animals

He's Crushin' It

Crush is a three year old black male. He ran 81 races at Southland Kennel Club. Now his is looking for a loving family that will have plenty of time and toys. He has tested kid and other large breed friendly, however he is not cat or small animal safe. Crush is very friendly and affectionate with anyone he meets. He walks up to everyone he meets like he has known you for years. He is not pushy, but he will lean on you and give you kisses. He loves being with the other greyhounds and he gets along greyt with anyone we put him with. He is as engaging with his playmates as he is with people. He will play bow to get them to play and he will initiate the daily zoomies. He enjoys playing with toys and once he finds the squeaker, he will trot around proudly squeaking away. He shares nicely with the others. If another greyhound wants the toy he has, he will let them have it and he moves onto another. This boy is a lover, not a fighter. We believe that due to his outgoing, friendly and affectionate nature, he would make a wonderful therapy greyhound. He likes to go out for walks and he walks nicely on a leash. He has a confident swagger and when you stop, he likes to lean on you. He enjoys all types of treats and he takes them all nicely from your hand. Crush would make a greyt first greyhound or a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

I would really love to be in a home where someone could spend lots of time with me! I love hunting lizards so please have a yard for me to run around in! I am still working on only going to the bathroom outside, but I have made improvements. I play with my foster brother, but really hate when he tries to take my favorite toy.

He does much better if another dog is with him as well, if left alone  for a couple of hours.  He eats watered down canned food, no hard kibble, as he has a very mild case of megaesophogus.

Dexi needs help with house-training and would benefit from an owner who has experience with training dogs with hearing issues or an adopter who is willing to learn. He needs someone with the time and patience to train him and earn his trust. He will need regular grooming and an understanding groomer

Lollie came to us from Georgia, where she had to fend for herself as a lonely stray.  One fine day she wandered onto the property of a family who's male dog lived outside on a chain.  Lollie and the handsome stranger struck up a friendship and soon became romantically involved.  She soon gave birth to a litter, but for reasons unknown to us, the puppies did not survive.

The family, doing what they must have thought to be the right thing, allowed Lollie to stay on at their house, sharing outdoor accommodations with their dog. Before very long... well, there's no need to finish that sentence.  This time the family realized that something had to be done and had the presence of mind to get her into rescue.  So she left Georgia on a midnight train, (a rescue transport), and 12 or so hours later, arrived at the shelter of Animal Alliance.  Two days after her arrival she gave birth to her litter, the beautiful little pups are safe and sound in our care.  As of this writing, 7/18 the little ones are 4 weeks old.  In a few more weeks, the whole little family, including Momma, will be spayed/neutered, vaccinated, et cetera, and ready to take their rightful places in their new adoptive families.

If you would like to meet, foster or adopt Lollie, all you have to do is fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION, which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - just copy and paste the link into your browser. 

Once we've reviewed your application, you can come and meet Lollie!  We think the two of you will hit it off!

Foster mom says I could be described as âVelcro.â I think thatâs the cheese that comes in a can, and it is one of my favorite things, so maybe she is right.
I was in a very scary shelter in CA for an eternity, officially 2 months. There was one person I liked in the shelter, and now that I have a foster mom, she is the one person I like. I havenât been around very many people in my life, and the ones I was around werenât always nice to me. I am scared of new people; Iâll bark and try to run away. If Iâm on a leash with foster mom or in a crate and foster mom is in the room, then I feel safe, and Iâm OK with new people. Iâm making progress in this area. I even took a few treats from the other lady who walks with us all the time.
Now on to the things that I like. I love playing with my foster sister, and if foster brother tries to get involved, I ignore him or play with him a little, but he is kind of a jerk. I like to carry things around in my mouth. I like to patrol the backyard in case any small birds or chipmunks try to invade. I love car rides. I love snuggling and getting patted. I love going on walks and I am really good and obedient on a leash. Iâm also good off-leash. Since Iâm so attached to foster mom, I donât usually let her get too far away from me.
Foster mom calls me Super-Duper Bradley Cooper because she says I am that good and that handsome.
Bradley is a calm, playful, loving goofball. He is afraid of new people and will need time to learn that people can be kind, friendly and safe. Given this sort of time and slow training, he will mature into a devoted and easy companion.
He is very smart, learns quickly, and definitely wants to please. He is extremely athletic and would make a great running or hiking companion. He is quiet and good in the house with great house manners. Bradley is a very loving and attaching sort of dog. He will do best in a home where he isnât left alone for long periods of time. Also no small children, just because they can be extra scary to dogs. Bradley is good with other dogs, sometimes playing and sometimes ignoring or avoiding. He currently lives with 5 dogs and hasnât had a single issue.
Bradley is already a dreamboat in so many ways, has tons of potential and will grow into an all-around delightful companion.
 Transport up to 1,500 miles is available!

He's a Hound, and when it comes to good-natured, agreeable sweetness, you can't do better than a Hound!  Not to mention, they've got beautiful, operatic singing voices!  Oh, and did you happen to notice those delightful hound dog ears? Simply marvelous!

He's extremely friendly, loves meeting new people and enjoys the company of other dogs.

He's a young fellow, only two, and a little portly, about 30 lbs, at the moment.  He's been making up for lost time since he's been with us, he likes to eat but his previous situation didn't provide much opportunity.  Our volunteers do their best to give him plenty of walks, but they have many other dogs and cats to look after, so he doesn't get sufficient exercise to balance out the new-found bounty of chow!

That's where YOU come in.

Otis can have his little bag packed and be ready to come home with you once he finishes up his heartworm treatment on 8/29/19 - And he's almost done!

Like nearly 100% of dogs who find themselves in rescue, Otis' prior situation was crumby, to say the least.  He spent the first two years of his life living outdoors, at the end of a chain, neglected and ignored.  Dogs who live outdoors, especially in the southern states, often contract heartworm disease as it is easily spread through mosquito bites.  He should not have any lasting effects from the heartworm treatment as he is young and strong, and is expected to live a normal healthy life going forward.

So here's what you need to do to get a jump on the crowd - Follow the link below to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION, fill it out and get approved to adopt early.  Then, when his HW treatment is finished, you can come and meet him in person.  If you guys hit it off, you're in like Flynn!

She's in the prime of life, only five years old so she's energetic, we're not talking \""bouncing off the walls\"" kind of energy, but she thoroughly enjoys long, leisurely walks.

You may have noticed from her glamor shots, she's a little on the chubby side, or pleasingly plump if you like... Okay, she looks like a sausage!  But that's part of her charm, and all the more reason to take those walks!

Paulina would be so happy to find a person or family to call her own, she gets a little lonely at the facility.  The volunteers spend as much time with her as they can, but they've got many other dogs and cats to care for, so she has to patiently wait her turn.

She's a good-natured little sweetheart who could be easily brought into the mix.

If you are looking for a dog that brings a smile to your face and makes you laugh, Lulu is the dog for you. Lulu has a wonderful attitude about life, she is happy and contented no matter what the situation. 

Lulu knows her basic commands: sit, stay, down, heel, off, look at me and crate. 
Lulu graduated from 2 positive training classes with Wonder Dogs in West Berlin, NJ All the trainers just loved her and she learned so fast. 

She would do best in a home with older children as she jumps when excited.
Lulu is a smart pup and a quick learner. She is even great with agility.  She also has learned how to walk on a tredmill for exercise.

When she is not enjoying a walk or some play time, Lulu wants to snuggle up close to you on the couch and give kisses. She's a real love bug.
While she enjoys an active lifestyle, she is crate trained and is not stressed out by spending time in the crate. Lulu is very housebroken.

Because she hasn't lived with another dog before we feel she would benefit from being the only dog. She can have neighborhood dog friends to Walk with and play dates at home with dogs once she gets to know them well, and if their play style is similar to hers. Lulu enjoys being the center of attention with the people who love her. 

Lulu is in need of a Foster Home, or an Adopter. She is living in one of our partner boarding kennels, since her family returned her because they were having a baby. 
She is taken care of by the staff and our volunteers everyday, but she misses being in a home with someone to cuddle with and a fenced yard to play in. 
We offer to anyone interested in fostering or adopting to start out with weekend sleepovers or day trips, to spend time getting to know each other. 

The adoption fee for Lulu is waived because it is sponsored.

If you are interested in fostering or adopting Lulu please contact us at wjvolunteers@yahoo.com.

THEO is a very well behaved little gent.  He's friendly, social, playful and sweet.  He enjoys his walks, and belly rubs, and any attention paid to him.  He loves being around his human friends and would be very happy to live in a home with a person or family who would take him places and include him in daily activities.

He's an excellent little watchdog and would make a great friend, and companion.

ABOUT THE MALTESE

\""Gentle, Playful, Charming

The tiny Maltese, âYe Ancient Dogge of Malta,â has been sitting in the lap of luxury since the Bible was a work in progress. Famous for their show-stopping, floor-length coat, Maltese are playful, charming, and adaptable toy companions.

Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese faceâwith its big, dark eyes and black gumdrop noseâcan conquer the most jaded sensibility.

Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training.\"" ~ AKC

Luna was adopted as a small puppy and got along great with all her former housemates, including four children (ages 11 and up) and two other pets (a male dog and cat).  She is good on a leash but can be barrier reactive, she needs a home with a strong backyard fence.

She's a trustworthy companion, a good-natured dog and is quite high energy, so needs regular daily exercise and mental stimulation.  She would fit in nicely in a home with experienced dog guardians who enjoy an active lifestyle; camping, hiking, day trips, daily walks, visits to the park... things of that nature.

ABOUT THE AMERICAN STAFFORDSHIRE TERRIER

\""Confident, Smart, Good-Natured

The American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident, good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.

AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type terriers standing 17 to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws well defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff movement is agile and graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breedâs innate confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe their dogs as keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and lovable âpersonality dogsâ around the house. AmStaffs like mental and physical challenges. They are highly trainable, as their many forays into showbiz suggest.\"" ~ AKC

We are a bonded pair and love running in the dog park.  We donât always come when we are called,  because as typical pointers, we think what's on the other side of the fence is so much more interesting.  We are also snugglers and will take over the couch in a heartbeat.  We're crate trained and sleep peacefully through the night in our safe place.  We're friendly with people and other dogs.  We are also good with children.  So far here in Virginia we haven't encountered any cats, so unsure of our likes and dislikes in that department.  Our foster Momma calls us her sweet pups and we totally agree with her.

Sport is a very sweet and gentle, 7 y/o B&W English Pointer. Sport came to PRO for a kennel in North Carolina. He is even AKC registered field trained. Cool! However, Sport has spent his entire life working hard and it shows! He really deserves a soft hand and a soft place to land from here on out. He is the sweetest little soul! Very loving! Super submissive! He does great in his kennel and has not marked on anything in the house! This was a very happy surprise, as he has never lived in a house. During the day, Sport loves to chew on a chew toy or loves to make blanket hole art (like true pointer fashion) ?? Sport does ok on leash. However, sport is blind and is still learning the world in his new darkness. According to his vet records, February 2018, Sport got an eye injury that lead to his total blindness in both eyes. Heâs adapting to his new environment very quickly, much to my surprise! In only a few short days, Sport has learned all by himself to go upstairs, to the bedroom and use the dogs stairs to get on the big bed! Heâs no dummy! He is one smart cookie! 

I think Sport would be an excellent companion dog! He would do wonderful with cats or kiddos. He has no quirks, other then being blind and even that doesnât stop him. He is as sweet as sweet can be! 

Sport is UTD on shots and neutered. If you are interested in adopting Sport, He is available through Pointer Rescue Org. pointerrescue.org

Riley is a sweet, loving, goofy 3 year-old. He loves playing with the resident dogs in his foster home, is a wonderful running/hiking companion, and happily curls up on the couch with his humans or canine buds. Riley loves road trips and is the perfect passenger (even when youâre trying to eat and drive). 

Riley does well on a lead with a harness. Heâs an easy walk until a squirrel or certain types of birds come into view. Barking dogs, noisy traffic, neighborhood kids donât seem to phase him, but certain animals (weâre still figuring out Rileyâs âfavoritesâ) may cause him to pull or stalk and point.  

Riley is not a picky eater nor has he shown any food aggression. He is âfood curiousâ and may stiff at other bowls and eye the counter if food is within sight or smell. So, best to keep counters cleared and safe.

Riley has good manners and knows sit, stay (mostly) and shake. He is a fast learner and eager to please. Riley has shown some minor separation anxiety, which his foster family is working with him. Riley arrived in his foster home with a fear of being crated. He is being SLOWLY introduced to the crate and it is uncertain how well he will do with crate training. He as been left with the resident dogs in the house and has been the perfect gentlemanâ¦no accidents or destruction. 

Riley would be his best self if there was another dog in his forever home. However, Riley CANNOT be in a home with cats or small animals (birds, rodents, bunnies, etc.). In the Old Life of Riley, his âaffinityâ for chickens got him into trouble with the local farmer and earned him an outlaw nickname of âJohny C.â In the Old Life of Riley, he also was an escape artist. He has not exhibited these tendencies in his foster home, but it is strongly recommended that Riley have a securely fenced in yard or be an urban apartment dweller.  

Riley is a sweet guy and will make the perfect forever dog. All thatâs missing from the New Life of Riley is you!

Riley is heartworm negative and will be neutered and microchipped before he heads to his forever home.

JD is one cool dude!  You know it the minute you meet him, the tail is going full-tilt.  He's a really sweet and good-natured dog who's game for anything.  He just wants to be your buddy, he doesn't care what you're doing, he's in!

JD loves attention of any kind; hugs, kisses, belly rubs, moving his lips to make him talk... anything!  He's the kind of dog that would even find a bath enjoyable, because that's attention, and any attention is good in his book!

He loves his walks, he likes being outside and he enjoys riding in the car.  There's really not much this dog doesn't like!

ABOUT THE LAB

Friendly, Active, Outgoing

The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering âotter tailâ seems to be forever signaling the breedâs innate eagerness.

Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But donât mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.

She is a very cautious girl when you first meet her but it doesnât take long before she warms up and becomes the sweetest girl. She is full of love and is anxious to show it. 
AnnaBella has had some training, she walks well on a leash, sits when asked and comes when called. She is potty trained and sleeps all night in her crate. She is good with other dogs after a slow introduction. She loves to play with her foster sister.

They got me some good food and a doctor of my own, and Iâm almost ready to start the next (and best) chapter of my life! My doctor is taking care of my heart worms and I will finish treatment and be ready to go to my new family in mid-September. 

    My favorite things are food, playing with my ball in the yard, playing with my foster brothers, snacks, running in the yard, and eating. Did I mention playing and eating?!

    My ideal family would spend time running and playing with me, and maybe has a human or dog friend, too! Initially, I was evaluated as not being good with cats, but I donât pay my foster-cat-brother any attention at all. I really hate thunder storms, but my parents have some medicine that helps me not be as scared. I donât really love taking baths, but Iâm told they have to be done.

    If you think I may be the one for you, just let PRO know! My foster parents would love to get to know you!

The buddy was adopted and Tasha was not handling shelter life alone very well. The shelter then reached out to Good Karma Dog Rescue for help and we were happy to have an open foster home who fell in love with Tasha right away. She is spayed, microchipped and fully vaccinated. She likes other dogs but also could just live life as a solo couch potato, too. She is good with most kids as well but should be over 13 so she doesn't get spooked so easily. Cats are unknown but she doesn't seem to have a high prey drive so we could always do a cat test. She does know many hand signals, knows sit, place, no, yes, shake and high five, and she is crate trained and housebroken. She is a total love muffin!! Her favorite things are 
going for car rides to get puppacinos! She also is great for baths and brushing! Tasha weighs approx 55 lbs full grown.

\""Say, I was thinking. If we could figure out a way to spend some quality time together, there are so many cool things I could show you. For example, did you know that there's a dog beach in Asbury Park?  Dogs are allowed on the Boardwalk and on the 8th avenue Dog Beach all day between 9/15 and 5/15.  It's a really nice place to go in the cool weather, especially at night!  I could show it to you! Have you ever hiked up at Ramapo Mountain State Forest?  That's another cool place I could take you, there are so many beautiful trails, (and fall foliage is coming!), you can even hike up to some ruins!  I'll bet you think you know your neighborhood like the back of your hand, but you've never walked it with me, I'll show you all kinds of cool stuff that you probably never noticed before!  Do you like going for rides?  I dig rides!  If you'll drive, I'll ride shotgun, we can go on road trips together or maybe some snack runs on movie night! There's so much fun stuff we could do,  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!

You know, I think I may have figured out a way.  FOSTER to ADOPT!  We could try it!  If you'll come to HQ and get me, I can come and stay at your house for a few days or even a week or two if you want. It would be like a really long sleepover! Doesn't that sound like fun?  Oh, one more thing, do you know how to give a belly rub?

Oh man, I can't wait 'til you get here!\""  ~Dee Dee

He is a super sweet, very young (1-ish) English Pointer. He is a beautiful little lemon with a kiss spot! He is on the smaller side, weighing in at 40#...however he is is still gaining weight!

Tippy is a fun goofy puppy! Heâs got energy. He loves to run around the yard whiling carry any toy he chooses. He loves to play ball and is learning how to bring it back...which then turns into a game of keep away from momma LOL.  Tippy gets along well with all his other foster siblings, big or small and male or female. He does prefer the ladies tho LOL. His favorite thing to do is to chase them or they chase him. He loves a good puppy wrestling match. 

When tippy arrived it was obvious he never lived in a house and so many noises and events were new to him. He is still learning to adjust to them but the vacuum is still not his favorite. He is also house broken and goes into his crate nicely. He does sleep in the big bed at night and loves to snuggle. Tippy is still very young and does like to chew, so lots of toys needed to keep him occupied. Tippy is still learning basic commands and will need some more training with this but is eager to please! Heâs good on leash, however does get startled from time to time with all the noises and new experiences but quickly adjusts. 

Tippy Roo Roo has come so far since he came to us at the end of March. Heâs turning into a fine young man! He is a pleasure to be around and to watch him as he discovers the goodness of love & life. Anyone or family would be lucky to have him as a FURever member of their family!

Thereâs so much to learn, but I am making progress and weâre working on hand signals so that we can communicate.  Iâm currently living with two other Pointers and a couple of humans â the dogs are OK and I enjoy playing with them, but the humans are my real favorites! I love being with my humans!

She has not been cat-tested but does well with other dogs and is good around children.  She is crate trained and is learning basic indoor skills.  Because of her significant energy level and her deafness she will need an adopter able to provide an environment where she can receive the training appropriate for a deaf dog along with the exercise that she needs  â could you be that special person?

In his previous life as a forgotten prisoner, he had dug a hole under the car to get out of the cold, see photos 2 and 3.

Snickers was an awful neglect case but he holds no grudges.  This 8 pound, ten year old senior is so deserving of a home where he will be loved in his golden years.  Snickers has low vision  but he doesnât run into anything and gets around just fine.    He can follow you around the house or outside.  He is also deaf but that doesnât hamper him either.  Housetrained, cratetrained and never barks, Snickers is a quiet little one who just wants human companionship, and while he is a special needs dog he is very low maintenance!  He will do well in a nice easygoing environment where someone is home much of the time.  Snickers has made a beautiful transformation in rescue and he will thrive in a loving home! Where are all our senior-loving dog families??  We will also consider a âforever foster homeâ (where a family will love and take care of him and we will take care of his medicals) in the Monmouth or Ocean Counties in MJ.

We try not to play favorites, but I must admit, Lana is one of my personal favorites. Lana came to us all skin and bones. She simply needed a good de-worming and good food. Now we need to cut her food back a little because she is on the chubby side. She is about 2-3 years old. We quickly discovered Lana's intelligence. She knows her basic commands and does them well. She knows sit, stay, down, paw and high five. She is ready to learn more. She has great energy and walks like a champ on her leash. Take her for a long walk or a run. Lana will stay by your side (on a leash, of course). She is a petite little girl, short little legs and a small body. She weighs about 35 pounds. Lana is great with all people. She can be a little nervous at first but go slowly and it takes her all of 5 minutes to be your best friend. She is not a fan of cats and a dog meet would be needed if you have another dog. Please stop in and meet Lana very soon. She is waiting for you.

WINNIE looks like a miniature Scottish Deerhound, a breed of course, which does not exist yet, but perhaps she's the first prototype!

WINNIE is sweet, gentle and a bit shy at first, but she warms up quickly.  She's quite social and gets along well with other dogs and even cats.  She enjoys her walks and it's a pleasure to walk her because she's very well behaved on a leash.

She's playful, lovable and good-natured and will make an excellent friend and companion.  WINNIE would be very happy to be part of a home where she'd be included in family activities.

WHAT'S NEXT?

He's a hard worker, or at least he would be if he had a job to do!  Border Collie's are working dogs and ECHO is a quintessential Border.  He wants a job!  He's always looking for something productive to do so he would be happiest as part of a family who keeps a small flock of pet sheep in their backyard.  Failing that, he would really like to be with a person or family who enjoys an active lifestyle.

If you are into camping, hiking, playing frisbee, running or perhaps interested or involved in canine agility games and competitions, ECHO is your man!

ECHO is very clever, most Borders are, so he needs mental stimulation as well as physical challenges. The more enrichments you can provide the happier he'll be.

They only flaw he's got, and it's not a big one, is that he doesn't like to share his food.  He's protective of his bowl when he's eating.  So he should be fed separately from other dogs and just allowed to eat his meal, undisturbed.  This behavior can either be accommodated as described, or addressed with training.

ABOUT THE BORDER COLLIE

Affectionate, Smart, Energetic

Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns.

The almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expressionâan intense gaze, the Borderâs famous âherding eyeâ, is a breed hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdomâs most agile, balanced, and durable citizens.

The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, like agilityâor herding or obedience workâis key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved with strangers.

WHAT'S NEXT?

Well, you can foster, foster-to-adopt, (in case you're not sure) or adopt ECHO.

His family finally gave him up for good, but not before the stress of the last few years had really taken a toll on poor Freckles.  He's about 8 1/2 years old now and Freckles has skin, eye, and ear issues, all of which are being treated, but all of which were likely brought on by stress.

My name is Lily. I am embarking on a new adventure in a place called PointerRescue Foster Home! It seems I have spent my entire life taking care of babies.  I am told it is now my time to retire from babies.  I am not sure what that means but so far I like the change in my life. I am learning how wonderful life can be sleeping on a couch, playing, and having regular meals, learning a new way of life and something called house manners. Foster Mom and Dad say I am a quick learner and smart and that will help me on another adventure called My Forever and Ever Home.  That has a nice ring to it. It sounds like a place where there are people who love me and I can love them. Oh I do hope this adventure comes soon. 

Now my foster folks would like to say a little more about me!

Lily is about 6-7 years old who appears to have had many litters of puppies. She is a happy girl with a lot of energy and a smile that will melt any heart.  Because she has taken care of so many babies, she likes to mother all the squeaky toys in the foster home. She is a strong girl yet has a gentle mouth. She is crated trained and has learned to use a doggy door. Lily is starting to learn basic house manners and learning to walk on a leash without pulling. If you drop her leash she will pick it up and walk herself!  She is smart and seems to learn quickly but has a way to go. She gets along with the other dogs in the foster home and is a submissive to them.   She has yet to be tested with children and cats. She was oblivious with her one brief encounter with a cat at the vetâs office. It is uncertain at this time if she is birdy or hunts.

Lily is heartworm negative and up to date on her vaccines. She is microchipped.

Lily would love to continue her adventure with you!

We will only place in a perfect setting for her own needs.  She came into our Rescue a couple years ago, as a Feral dog. Gracie has suffered much abuse in her life and neglect as well, a very unwanted Girl.  Gracie lived on the streets of Tennessee, where she was Maced in her face, had 2 Litters of Pups, who were both shot in front of her.. then she was Finally trapped, so she could at least be Spayed. She then sat in a kill shelter, again. . Unwanted..  she was Sprung by some nice ladies and sat in Boarding, in an outside kennel, with no Humane contact. I brought her to our Rescue because she broke my heart..  Gracie does come around, but you have to go very easy, and be patient. She does love other dogs, she led dogs in Tennessee to the food being left out for her, and let them eat FIRST..  She is very loving, once she trusts you, but you can't push her. She is still not ready to be leash walked, and honestly may never be. She remembers all too well having a catch pole around her neck. She could definitely go home with Cookie, also for Adoption here, who she loves. Little kids are not a good idea as she will spook easy from quick movements. A fenced yard is a requirement as well. A single person, retired, or home on disability, who is calm and quiet and could spend a lot of time with her, would be awesome for her. I'm not setting an Adoption Fee here, because I just want her HAPPINESS.. Again, I will not let her go unless we are 200% sure it is her best situation, and I'm hoping it will be local to me, so I can assist with the adjustment, and I would like to be able to visit with her.

Goose is a handsome and cuddly 1 year old pointer mix (we think with Labrador Retriever), originally from Arkansas. He, along with his mother and his siblings were living outside an abandoned home, and needed rescue quickly to keep them safe. We are not certain who his dad was, but because of his looks, his dad sure was a handsome gent!
Goose is very sweet, and loves to give full body hugs. Goose is good with dog and cats, and is a total lovebug. He is working on his leash manners, as he is a little uncertain with loud city noises. Goosey is goofy and sweet, snuggly and handsome.
Some notes from his foster home:
Goose is a typical young dog who needs exercise and stimulation.  He is also a big boy (around 75 lbs) and he would do best with another dog (or 2!) who is willing to run and play with him in the yard to burn off some energy.  He is willing to entertain himself (see the video here: Goose Entertains Himself with Gymnastics! ).  He is fascinated with birds and butterflies, and squirrels are possibly the most exciting thing ever!
Perhaps due to his time abandoned, he does show some resource guarding.  He eats in his crate at his foster home, and high-value treats like knucklebones need to be closely monitored with other dogs around.  He freely exchanges anything he has for a cookie with his foster parents.  He is very food motivated and knows sit and down, but his recall is still a work in progress.  His leash walking is improving, but if he sees a squirrel, all bets are off!

Theirs is a story that's lasted for years....in and out of shelters because their owner was in and out of jail and each time just left them to fend for themselves till ACO picked them up.  Because Zoey is deaf and depends on Copper, we are networking them as a bonded pair.  As such, they were rescued previously by a group that took funds collected by donations and then returned them WITHOUT VETTING to their owner.  THEN....again they found themselves homeless and in the shelter so a group took them and has been covering all vetting, boarding and care for over a year now.  

READ THEIR STORY on their very own Facebook page at:  https://www.facebook.com/A-Rescues-journey-Meet-Copper-and-Zoey-947194962146386/?modal=admin_todo_tour

This pair loves each other.  They are fun loving and happy go lucky pups who just finally need a break in their lives.  I have never seen dogs that have had so much hard luck and am praying they find the home and family they need.......and who needs them.

We believe Zoey is 4 and Copper is 5, both are pit mixes, up to date on vaccines, HW negative, on HW preventatives, also flea and tick preventatives, microchipped and spayed/neutered. Copper also recently had his teeth cleaned. They are a healthy and happy duo! We are desperate to find them a foster home or an adopter looking to love a bonded pair.  They have been stuck in boarding for a year now.  They deserves better. Please help us help them move on to the next chapter of their lives! Both are dog friendly. We are unsure about cats. We would love to find a foster home so we can learn more about them and help them find their forever family.
These two are quite the pair! They are a lot of fun to be around.  Itâs instantly clear how much they love each other and their bond is very strong. If you are interested in our dynamic duo please reach out to Diamond Dogs Rescue, Inc. at TKDiamond@aol.com."

MEET BRODY!

This very handsome American Bulldog is seeking a new home ... the two small dogs in the home do NOT like him so the current guardian sadly needs to find Brody another forever. 

Brody is typically calm and docile. He LOVES his chew toys. He is very protective of his humans. He is fine with adult strangers if they give a slow approach and he does behave in a mellow fashion around his guardians.

His ideal home would be a quiet one, one that knows, loves and respects the breed. One where they understand his need for routine and predictability. An adult only home would be best. Brody has had experience only with the small dogs in his home, so any other dogs would have to be compatible (intros needed).

Brody knows basic commands such as sit, go back, heel. He is VERY good on the leash and loves his walks!

Brody is about five yrs old and weighs about 80 lbs. He is utd on his shots and is neutered. 

Want to know more? Arrange a visit? Please contact reboundhounds@gmail.co and we will forward your reply to the current guardian. 

BRODY IS IN MULLICA HILL, NJ"

When Krystal first arrived she was very under weight, would sleep standing up in her kennel would even try to sleep standing up when not in the kennel. She was very under socialized she is starting to feel better with other dogs around but still needs to learn to be more relaxed about them. I would only recommend she be an only dog or go to a home with a very confident dog in it. She has gone through basic training and has excelled she is very intelligent and eager to learn. She's good in her kennel and house broken. She likes to snuggle up with you or is also happy playing with her toys she is self entertaining. She can be a little rough when playing so I would suggest a family with no smaller children.

He was found in very rough shape.  Some good Samaritans got him much needed vet care and contacted us.  He is new to living in a house, and he has had some rough treatment in the past.   Now he is healthy, and happily adjusting to life indoors.   Hank is a VERY loving, gentle dog that loves every person and animal he meets.    He lives happily with two dogs and a cat in his foster home.  When he goes out on walks, he is like the goodwill ambassador for dogs; he wants to meet and greet every dog he sees. 
 
Hank is doing well on housebreaking, and is learning basic commands.  Heâll need his new family to help him continue to learn about life in a house and show him that the humans are in charge of taking care of things, since he is used to fending for himself.   He will want to climb in the refrigerator and help you forage around in there.  Heâs very food motivated.  Heâs also very resourceful about finding food and will get into the trash if he can.   He walks great on a leash and loves car rides.  He is just learning how to play and is starting to become happy and silly.   But after his short bursts of energy, he is content to spend much of his day sleeping.   
 
Hank has a little secret:  heâs a coonhound!   We thought he was a Pointer when we accepted him into rescue, but once we picked him up, we realized he is mostly coonhound.  His ideal adopter will be someone who loves the coonhound personality and voice.  Hank has a typical coonhound bay and can be pretty vocal at timesâhe barks like a sea lion when he is excited or wants something, or sometimes, just because he can.  He likes to announce his presence when he goes out on his daily walks.  Itâs pretty cute, sometimes annoying, but all part of Hankâs big gentle personality. 
 
Hank would love a peaceful, calm retirement home.   He likes a stable, quiet routineâdaily walks, an occasional run with you in nature, and lots of time on the sofa, hanging out with his big old hound dog head in your lap.  Please get in touch if youâd like to learn more about Hank.


Donations toward his care are graciously accepted here : http://www.pointerrescue.org/donation.html

What we know about Indi:
*loves people
*housebroken
*gentle guy
*would do best as the only dog

What Indi's foster home has to say about him:
Indi is an amazing senior soul. He is a loyal love bug that gives new meaning to Velcro dog! And he is an incredibly smart guy, his superpower is to accurately predict where you are walking or planning to walk, and Indi will stand between you and your destinations. Indi is extremely loyal and will follow you around everywhere you go. When you sit down, he will go to sleep.  He is an awesome power napper!  Indi can sleep for hours at a time, and this is his second super power. Indiâs favorite sleeping area is a large orthopedic bed.

 When Indi first came into foster care he had a lot of pain and had problems walking. He is now on pain meds and has a very adorable swagger. He also has spinal stenosis that causes hips to sway when he walks. 

Indi has a heart murmur which is a leaky valve. He came to us with a cough caused by his heart murmur,  and so he is on meds that are helping his heart (and that will need to be maintained for the rest of his life).  Indi wears a belly band because his heart meds make him thirsty and we think the pain meds keep him from feeling when his bladder is full. Indi is full of personality when he comes inside from potty, he demands a treat for going out and getting his belly band on. Indi is so smart, that when he goes out to potty at night, all his foster dad has to do is shine a flashlight and he will come trotting back to the house! 

 Indi does do well with other dogs but we think he would also love to be in a home where heâs the only dog and the center of attention, so he can soak up all the love you can give him! 

A little bit about his background:  Indiâs family moved and left him behind. The neighbors were feeding him before they called for animal control. Indi ended up in a vets office, who reached out to rescue.  We were told that indi was blind when he came into rescue; however he can see just fine, although we do think that he is deaf. Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately."

Good With Older Kids and Other Large Breeds
No Cats or Small Animals

Such A Greyt Guy

Yates is a four year old brindle male. He ran 113 races at Tri-State Greyhound Park. Now he would love to find a comfy forever couch and a lot of toys. He has tested older kid and other large breed friendly, however he is not cat or small animal safe. Yates is just a big puppy. He loves to run and play with or without the other dogs. He gets along greyt with the other greyhounds in his playgroup and he shares nicely. If another greyhound wants the toy he has, he will simply let them have it and move onto the next toy. He just loves all the toys, but he really loves the ones that are still capable of making noise. When he hears a squeak, his ears perk up and he looks like he is standing at attention. He will initiate the zoomies and he loves to get in the front of the pack. He doesn't need other dogs to have fun. He can do his zoomies and play all on his own. He enjoys getting attention and always has a big smile on his face. He does not like having his feet touched and he has growled during his nail clipping. Due to his playful nature and his feet issue, we will only place him in a home with older kids (10+). He loves to go out for walks and once he settles down, he walks nicely on a leash. He enjoys all kinds of different treats, but he has not started to take them from our hands. Yates would make a greyt first greyhound or a wonderful addition to an existing pack."

We would prefer for her new home to have a fenced in yard so that she can run and get her energy out however it is not a requirement for adoption. 

Lulu was originally rescued from down south where she was badly abused. She has been rehabilitated through obedience training. Lulu would do best in a home where she is the only fur baby. She would also do best in a home with older children as her energy can be overwhelming to little ones.

Lulu is spayed, up to date on her vaccines, and is currently on heartworm and flea/tick medication. Lulu has also been crate trained and travels well in the car.

Lulu is currently with her family, however they are looking to rehome her as they are seniors and did not realize how much energy Lulu had."

She was found as a stray at 6 months old and rescued from a local shelter when the shelter was at capacity. Flower is spayed, up to date with vaccinations, heart worm negative and microchipped. She is full grown at approximately 50 pounds.

Flower is great on a leash and loves to go for walks.  She loves chasing balls and sticks and chewing marrow bones.  She will sit for treats and is very food motivated. She is very responsive to the opening of the refrigerator cheese drawer and loves to sleep with her foster mom. Flower is very sweet, she loves people, gives kisses and is very affectionate. She can be stubborn and aloof at times (typical teenager!) and is 90% house broken. 

Flower would be great in a home if there were one other dog with a comparable energy level and play style â she does like to play rough! She spent the first 3 months in foster care with another young pup named Betty. She and Betty were very attached to each other and Flower had some separation issues when Betty was first adopted â so we would love to see Flower placed with another dog. We believe she would also do well as an only dog but would need a home where she is not alone for more than 4 hours a day. A fenced yard is required.

She adores her people and loves them with every fiber of her being. However she needs time to warm up to new people.

We knew that when we accepted Pepsi into our adoption program that we would be looking for a special adopter for Pepsi. Someone who understands what its like to be afraid and abandoned and who will give her the time she needs to feel comfortable and gain confidence.

Pepsi is sensitive and responds well to positive reinforcement training. She needs encouragement and gentle guidance. Once she knows you she will be your bestest friend and you can look forward to days of leisurely walks, cuddles and games of fetch.

While he can sometimes be scared of new people or places, he warms up quickly once he knows you are his friend. Heâll be bringing you one of his favorite toys to play with or trying to crawl into your lap for pets in no time. He does have a lot of energy and would enjoy a home who has time to play fetch with him or take him for long walks. He is also super smart and has learned many basic commands, is housebroken and really wants to please his people. He is treat and toy motivated and loves training. Nathan is also playful with other dogs but sometimes needs a slow intro. He is only two years old and has a high energy play style that some older or laid back dogs may not like. But generally once he is introduced properly, while he has lost of energy he also is very appropriate and play bows and rolls over on his back to make other dogs feel more comfortable.

Nathan came to us from a local shelter. He had been brought in by police after he was taken from his previous owner who kept him crated 24 hours a day with no food and water. He was underweight and understandably afraid of everything. Nathan has come such a long way showing how strong, forgiving and resilient he is. His ideal home would be in a quiet suburban or rural area as sometimes new things or loud noises still scare him. He would do best in a home with teens and up.

Nathan is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm negative. He is around two years old."

Zooey found herself at the shelter and was very afraid. She is a very shy dog even after months of being at her foster home. It took her a few months to learn what a toy is, and now enjoys them, but has not learned how to play with people or dogs yet. When the house is quiet she comes out to observe what is going on, but unless called she does not seek attention. She will require someone who is willing to work on all of the basics with her, due to her socialization issues, but her foster mom promises to help. 
Zooey requires long slow introductions but is good with kids and other dogs, she has not met the resident cat. 
Zooey would do best in a calm home, that is willing to give her the time she needs to know she is safe. It may take a bit of time to get her to feel comfortable in a new home, but it is worth it! She would be fine around kids, as long as the kids are willing to leave her alone when she wants quiet time. She currently likes to stay under the foster parent's bed, but sometimes sneaks onto the bed at night for a little attention. 

Zooey was originally known as Speckles.

~ A subtle but classic Boxer under-bite including the must-have, tiny protruding dog-chin accompaniment, as well as the all-important lower fangs over the upper lips feature, (particularly when she has a question). 

~ Velvety, floppy triangular ears that when positioned in a particular way, (such as when she's requesting a treat), resemble the habit worn by The Flying Nun.

~ Soft, round silky head that fits perfectly in the palm, making the petting experience exquisitely enjoyable for all parties concerned.

~ Soft indentation between the eyes, perfect for kissing.

~ Perpetual motion device (tail), strong, sturdy and reliable.

~ Soft-brown, soulful eyes full of nothing but love.

~ Rarely heard soft and raspy Boxer voice.  Generally demonstrated when there is a desire to play.

~ Obsolete features no longer included: pesky rear dewclaws, endless stream of snotty drool, and reproductive capabilities... GONE! 

Interior Features:

~ She's as sweet as birthday cake!  Mildred likes being affectionate as much as she likes receiving affection, and that's a lot!

~ She's an outstanding companion, whatever you want to do, she's down.  Want to go for a snack ride?  Cuddle on the couch and watch Netflix?  Go for a walk?  Need company in the kitchen while you cook?  Sit in a lawn chair and read a book?  She's right there with you.

~ No trouble whatsoever, she's perfectly well mannered.  Completely house trained, quiet and not at all destructive.

~ Gives kisses upon request, as many as desired.

~ Points out squirrels.  She actually points them out, standing frozen with one front paw raised and her tail straight out.  Now, she's not going to exhaust herself chasing them or anything, she might make a half-hearted attempt, but the important thing is now YOU know they're there and can take measures to protect yourself. 

~ Plays Pat-a-Cake.  Occasionally, when she's on her back and feeling frisky, she'll look at you askance and throw up her front paws inviting you to participate in a game of Pat-a-Cake, sometimes Miss Mary Mac.

This rare gem won't last long, so you must act now!

At the time she was rescued, DELLA was about nine months old and weighed  only 17 pounds--she was literally skin and bones --her fur was scanty, her ribs and hipbones were fully visible, and her paws were splayed from malnutrition.  DELLA is now a normal weigh for her size, and enjoys the activities she had been deprived of in her former life.    Her coat is thicker and more lustrous and she now has the stamina to play and run in her fenced yard.   Despite the neglect she experienced, DELLA is a happy girl and she is looking for a forever home with guardians who will provide security, care and love.

Meet Jack. He enjoys walks, snuggling, car rides, playing with toys, enjoys being close with his owner. 

Jack is a 10 year old, retired plantation hunting dog, approximately 55 pounds, heartworm negative on monthly preventative, and up to date on shots. He was neutered in August 2018 and microchipped. 

Originally from Oklahoma, currently living and a foster family in north western Pennsylvania, Jack has adjusted to the snow belt well. He can be tied out briefly to go potty and is not a barker. Jack knows the word no and promptly complies. 

He enjoys going on walks and sticks close to you in the yard. Jack is housebroken, crate trained, and very quiet. He is very quick to catch onto routines, follows them without any instructions, and goes right into his kennel knowing that heâs going to get a yummy treat. 

Jack should be in a cat free home. If you have another dog, the dog would just have to be chilled and very relaxed - not an Alfa type. A fenced yard would be best to keep Jack safe and give him the freedom to explore, but isnât absolutely necessary.

If you are loving, can supply joint supplements, good food, and an orthopedic bed , I will be forever yours.

I am girl on the smaller side but don't let my under 40 lb stature fool ya - I have the energy of a bigger pointer!
I wasn't properly taken care of in my previous life, in fact I lived my entire life chained outside where I had litter after litter. I didn't get regular vet visits or dental care so I am not as drop dead gorgeous as others but my beauty still shines !     I had pretty bad flea bite dermatitis and a sunburn, as well as heartworms.  I have been treated for heartworms and I'm almost ready for my next stage in life - a FUREVER family. I love snuggling on the couch helping my foster mom watch scary movies, with or without my Kitty friends and my a few of my calm foster Buddies. Because I wasn't treated very nicely in the past and had no way to defend myself against unwanted suiters, I prefer calmer dogs to hyper ones. I love leash walks, and I love Adventures and meeting people. I thought about applying for a position to be a Walmart greeter, but they are open 24 hours and I need my couch time. Do you have room in your heart for a gal who can't wait to be pampered?

We recently discovered that Patty has inoperable cancer and she will be living out her remaining days in one of our foster homes.

Momma Cass is a Terrier Mix who was surrendered to a high kill shelter with her puppies. 

Iâm a bit over 2 and full of love and fun.  I didnât have a great beginning, but Iâm looking for my happily ever after with a family that loves to cuddle, watch TV (sports or Netflix, or even the news), go for walks, and maybe even a winery or two that allow dogs.  We can go shopping in a lot of smaller towns.  No matter where we go I will be well behaved and gentle.  I am not an alpha dog, but I will protect our home and alert you to strangers.  Iâm not a big yard type of dog, as Iâd rather cuddle or play with another dog.  But, if you go outside, Iâm there!  We could even get coffee at Starbucks or sleep in.  Iâm good either way.  Iâm not the type to wake you up to go out early in the morning.  So if youâre looking for unconditional love and are ready for a commitment, Iâm your gal.

She's vaccinated, microchipped, spayed, and current on her flea/tick/HW meds. If you would like to add this pretty gal to your family, fill out an adoption application here: http://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/ICY0zLb5eMAfRd8dptd7"

I was found along a busy road in Georgia after being hit by not one, but two cars. Luckily, only an arm was dislocated. A Good Samaritan saw my plight and was compelled to hook me up with Pointer Rescue. Now Iâm all fixed up, living in a foster home in New York, and loving every minute of it! It is likely that I had a hard life in my 10 years before finding my way to Pointer Rescue, but you would never guess that upon meeting me. Iâm as sweet, gentle, and easy going as they come. My tail is wags nonstop!

I am eager to please and very friendly with dogs and cats, but what I love most is being around people. Iâve had the opportunity to live with a couple teeny tiny humans and they are pretty great, too! At this point in my life, I am just looking for a soft place to rest and someone to send a little kindness my way. In return, Iâll be your devoted companion and content to sit beside you on the couch or lie at your feet as you go about your day. Because I am so easy and undemanding, my foster mom takes me to her office so that I can supervise her when she is working. Pointers make excellent project managers and supervisors!

Iâm what youâd call a low-energy pointer. That means that I walk beautifully on leash without pulling and I have plenty of pep to enjoy neighborhood walks and hikes in the woods, but I am equally content to keep your couch warm. I also ride very nicely in the car. I enjoy human affection in the form of pats and scratches, but I am not obnoxious about demanding them. I am a distinguished gentleman and have good manners. I know how to bark, but rarely find reason to use my voice. I donât mind being crated, but can be trusted loose in the house.  I know that Iâm supposed to do my business outside.

A fenced yard will be best to keep me safe and give me the freedom to explore, but isnât absolutely necessary. I know where the good food and soft beds are located! My foster family has observed that I have a pretty short âinvisibleâ leash. Once I bond with you Iâll stick to you like glue, but I will require some training to develop 100% reliable recall.

I was recently microchipped and tested negative for heartworms. I am neutered and vaccinated and have been put on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives and dewormed. I am well behaved for nail trimming, ear cleaning, bathing and brushing.

MOLLY likes people and other dogs and is the perfect size,(approximately 40-pounds).  She came to Animal Alliance in January 2018 with her three adorable puppies who have all found their forever homes!  It wasn't until just recently that MOLLY was lucky enough to find her own foster home, prior to that she was at our shelter.  MOLLY has a mature big doggy brother in the home who she likes to play with and she is learning when to give him space.  She is also learning house skills and manners and her foster mom says she is eager to please and always tries her best!

MOLLY is not super high energy but has bursts of energy and would do best in a home with another young, active dog who she can tussle and play with.  After all that playing, (which should include one of her favorite activities, playing fetch with her humans!), she's happy to cuddle up on the couch with you.

These two are very sweet, loveable pups, and such a charming pair!  They enjoy their walks, getting special attention of any kind, as well as belly rubs, hugs, and kisses.

They would fit in nicely in almost any home and make delightful companions. 

THEIR STORY

BONNIE and BAXTER are lifelong best friends and must be adopted together.  Both came from a dreadful situation. Officers were called to an abandoned home by neighbors. The house was empty except for 2 dogs. These poor angels were left alone with little care; neighbors claim someone would come once a week to feed them. Officers removed them from the property.

We would love to see them adopted by a person or family who would shower them with enough love and affection to make up for all that lost time.

FROM AN AA VOLUNTEER:

 \""I visited BAXTER and BONNIE once a week during the summer as an Animal Alliance volunteer. BAXTER is a very gentle, kind older dog who enjoyed walking with me. BONNIE is sweet and a bit more introverted, but once she warms up to you, she also is affectionate. During the summer, this pair had a third dog roommate. They all got along very well.

\""I think that the pair would enjoy a farm setting or a home with some space in the backyard where they can safely go outside to enjoy their senior years. They also would enjoy quiet moments in someoneâs den just hanging out with a couple or a family. BAXTER particularly likes exploring nature while walking on a leash. Our family is not able to house them at this time. I am advocating for BAXTER and BONNIE because I fell in love with both of them, and would like to see them in a warm, caring home.\""

About PeeWee:
PeeWee's foster mom says he is the oddest guy! He is silly and sweet with lots of personality quirks. With a medium energy level and the ability to keep himself amused, combined with the fact that he is non-destructiveÂ when being left alone, he is a dream dog for just the right person. He loves giving LOTS of kisses and spending time with his family. He has the funniest personality to match his goofy ears.

PeeWee is a little shy when meeting new people but he quickly warms up and wants to make friends. He is very dog selective and would be best as the only dog in the house. He doesn't like being in a crate but is very well behaved when being left alone. He is housebroken and walks nicely on a leash although he much prefers hanging out in the backyard over going for a walk.

PeeWee's perfect forever family is one that has a yard for him to romp around in and has experience with terriers. Children junior high age or older as he can beÂ timid."

PEARL is quite the little character.  She's feisty, spunky and fiercely independent! She may look like a sweet little puppy that you can just pick up and kiss on that cute little gumdrop nose, but it's not advisable! Not unless she knows you.  PEARL is a dog who loves the people she loves and distrusts the people she doesn't.  In the right home, with the right person, PEARL will make an outstanding friend and companion, but it must be a person who understands her.  She will love you, but not necessarily your friends and acquaintances, at least not immediately, that may take a little time.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's just say this, PEARL is a very special little dog, and winning her love and trust is well worth the trouble.

Isnât there a home for me? I have been waiting a long time!
Hello! They call me Jaycee.  Sometimes Iâm called Peanut or Little Bit.  I have been told I am special.  Well, I donât know about that.  So since I am so special, why havenât I found a home yet?
Let me tell you a little about myself.  My story begins when things started getting dim in my world.  I was losing my sight. Itâs a scary thing when you canât see like you used to, and it is worse when you are lost and the ones you thought loved you arenât coming for you.  
Some people picked me up and took me to a scary place called Animal Control.  I knew I was in a cage. It was cold, there were strange dogs barking and crying and then there was talk about some of us not leaving.  People were telling me that they were trying to help me get out.  Next thing I knew some people from Pointer Rescue got me and are fostering me.  Itâs nice to have a bed and sleep inside a comfortable house. I have lots of room to run outside, but I prefer to be inside.  I especially enjoy running in the morning. 
And thereâs popcorn.  I love popcorn!  Anyway, my foster mom and dad said I can stay here until PRO finds me a forever home.  My foster mom says it will be a very special home because I am very special. I would love to be your special girl! Did I tell you I like popcorn?
Jaycee is small liver and white girl who is about 10-11 years old. She was picked up as a stray by a small city animal control in Georgia. Advocates for the shelter contacted PRO and she has been placed in a foster home that has several pointers. She is a rather timid girl, but gets along well with the other dogs. She is not exactly a social butterfly, but she will warm up to you especially if you have treats like popcorn. She is cautious of new people be now that is feels comfortable in her foster home, she will venture out to meet people. She has become a talker and will greet her foster parents when they come home with a âWoo Woo!â and demands treats!  Did we mention she likes popcorn?  
Jaycee is partially blind, but is able to get around the house and yard. Along with developing cataracts which is normal for a dog her age, she also has Keratoconjunctivitis. In spite of her vision problems, Jaycee manages rather well. She has learned to use the doggy door, and usually goes out when she is told to. Low light, of course,  gives her problems getting around.  She seems to like an established routine especially when it involves cookies and popcorn.  Did we mention that she loves popcorn?
 She is up to date on her vaccinations and is spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative.  She passed her last vet checkup with flying colors! Jaycee will keep to herself but can be coaxed out.  Jaycee will be wonderful with a family who can be patient with her as a transition to a new home will take time.  She has done well with children although she doesnât like a lot of commotion. She has, however, done well with the other four pointers in the house (that does create commotion at dinnertime!) She will jump right into the midst of the others with treats are being handed out.  
Jaycee is a special senior girl who deserves a special family.  Are you the family that will help Jaycee reach her potential?  Did we mention she loves popcorn?

She's so happy when she's the focus of attention.  She loves belly rubs, hugs, kisses, or just sweet words.  Her tail is always in motion.

FARRAH is quite social and loves the company of other dogs, so if you've got any, she'd like to meet 'em!  As a matter of fact, she's so comfortable around other dogs that she must be adopted into a home with other dogs, as she would not feel comfortable or secure if she was the only one.

If you enjoy activities like hiking, camping, going to the beach, going to the park, going on road trips, walks around the neighborhood, or just watching movies on the couch, FARRAH would be a delightful companion.

FARRAH's Son is also with us, his name is FITZ, they arrived together. If you think you might like to make room for the pair, go and have a look at his bio!

A LITTLE ABOUT THE RAT TERRIER

Friendly, Inquisitive, Lovable

An American original, with a breed name said to be coined by Teddy Roosevelt, the Rat Terrier is a compact, tough, smooth-coated exterminator dog. RTs come in two size varieties and are happy-go-lucky, playful, and portable companions.

HISTORY

Hereâs a breed that says up-front what theyâre all about: Rat Terriers are terriers bred to kill rats. A good ratter was standard equipment on old-time farms, where a rodent infestation could mean the difference between having enough grain to last the winter and going hungry. But practical-minded farmers expected their dogs to be more than specialists, so RTs also earned their keep as all-purpose hunting partners, watchdogs, henhouse guardians, and sturdy childhood playmates.

WHAT'S NEXT?

Why \""Smiling\"" Timmie?  Have you seen his pictures? Just look at that adorable little smile!  He's got the most delightfully expressive face.  It's enough to melt hearts!

Timmie is so easy to make happy.  He loves going for walks and rides in the car, belly rubs, hugs, kisses... in fact, attention of any kind makes Timmie supremely happy.

Timmie is a truly extraordinary pup, one-of-a-kind. This amazing little dog has had such a miserable life, enough to make the hardest of hearts break, yet he's lovable and sweet and just loaded with personality.

He's a stunner too!  Take a gander at that luxurious copper coat, and his deep, soulful brown eyes, not to mention his ever-so-slightly bowed front legs!  Somehow, in his off-the-charts cuteness, he conveys \""big dog\"" presence with that compact little 7-pound body of his, as he walks with a proud strut, showing the confidence and joy he feels whenever he gets special attention.

TIMMIE'S STORY

Timmie was one of many dogs rescued from a terrible hoarding situation that had come to the attention of the local authorities.  Animal Alliance had been called in to assist and we were able to rescue all of the dogs imprisoned in that awful place. The conditions they were languishing in were horrendous, there were far too many dogs and none of them were receiving the care they needed and it had been going on for a very long time. 

It's amazing that in spite of all Timmie's been through, his little spirit was never broken.  On the contrary, it shines like the Sun!

There's only one thing Timmie needs now... YOU!  He needs his own home, where he's #1, his own bed, his own toys, and his own beloved person.

We really want to get Timmie out of the shelter.  As far as shelters go, ours is 5-star, but it's still not a home, it's a temporary layover.  Timmie has spent far too much of his life in confinement already.  We really want him to have the loving home he deserves.  Might that be your home?

Little MARTHA is affectionate and sweet and loves going for walks, car rides and just being with her human companion.  She's a good-natured little friend, and very well-behaved, she'd easily fit in nicely with almost any family situation.  Despite having had a very unpleasant early life of nothing but confinement and neglect, she's healthy, happy, social and enjoys the company of other dogs.

What's needed is a kind soul, with a gentle and loving heart to make the last years of Little MARTHA's life the best she's ever had.

SOME of Little MARTHA'S EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES

* Perfectly round marble head, ideal for kissing.
* Ears that look like little bull horns.
* Gum-drop nose, also perfect for kissing.
* She walks like a tiny wind-up toy.
* One perfectly good eye!

LITTLE MARTHA'S STORY

Little MARTHA was rescued from a hoarding situation and transported to Animal Alliance from another rescue partner.  This incident occurred quite some time ago in 2014.  Since that time, Little MARTHA has been living at the AA kennel. There's no reason for this, she's actually an EXCEPTIONAL dog!  There are just SO many dogs in need of a home on Petfinder, that a little sweetheart like this one can easily fall through the cracks.

Little MARTHA was a young dog when she arrived, albeit tattered and neglected, now she's a senior.  But she's healthy and strong and Chiuahuahs are known for long lifespans, she could easily have another 8 or more good years.  It would be a crime for Little MARTHA to live out the rest of her life without knowing what it feels like to belong to someone, the be a beloved and treasured companion and friend.

OLDER DOGS ARE REALLY COOL...

...and I'll tell you why. Because they're already broken-in! Someone else has done all the heavy lifting. Taught 'em to take care of business outside, not to jump on company, some human language, how to be chill in the car, maybe even a few impressive tricks.

There's no better friend on Earth than a well-seasoned dog!

SO...

Meet Pretzel , a 2 year-old low-ridin' Staffy!!

This beefy boy wants to give you all his love 24/7. The only thing bigger than his head is his heart! Pretzel's favorite activities include giving hugs and kisses, cuddling on the couch, and a good romp in the yard! 

Pretzel is 100% house trained and not destructive when left alone. He is also crate trained--what a good boy!

Pretzel LOVES stuffed toys and likes to carry them around with him wherever he goes like they are his baby! Have an old children's stuffed animal laying around not being used? Pretzel would be happy to adopt it if you adopt him!

He is super food/treat motivated and eager to please . He is currently working hard on basic commands and leash training. Pretzel walks well in a harness. He will need someone to keep up with his training after adoption so he can perfect the basics!  

Do you have a pup at home? Pretzel would love to live with a tolerant dog who likes his exuberant play style or, better yet, shares that same play style! He is not possessive of his food or toys and letâs you take away treats from him. Pretzel is just here to please you! He can live with children 10+.

If youâre looking for a ball of love and fun this is your guy!

She showed up at 1 of our fosters house last month and didn't want to leave. After checking online in some of the local lost dog groups, it was discovered that she had been on the street for a couple of months. She had been posted and never claimed. At that point we decided she was no longer going to spend another day on the streets. We got her vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. She arrived in NJ this past weekend and is ready to find her furever family. Sunny approx 3 yrs old, 40 lbs, she is crate trained (although she's never had to be crated), housebroken, good with cats, she is ok with other dogs as long as they stay away from her, which is why we feel she would do best in a home with no other dogs. She has some scabs on her so we think she may have been attacked by other dogs while on the streets. She is AMAZING with children and loves everyone she meets!

Faith most likely lived a difficult life before being found as a frightened stray in Philadelphia.  Faith was found with much of her fur missing, underweight, frightened, and with some type of skin condition.    She arrived at an over crowded shelter and became even more frightened and started to emotionally shut down even further.  Her time was limited and thanks to supporters and friends of Sedona, we were able to bring her into our program before she was to be euthanized.

We estimate Faith to be about 7 to 8 years old.  At approximately 30 pounds, Faith is a shepherd mix, or a 'pocket shepherd'.   We are not quite sure what other breed she has in her, maybe a little collie, or even some chihuahua thrown in.  Since arriving at Sedona Shepherd, we have been providing her with the necessary medical care to get her on the road to recovery.  While Faith allows handling, she is sensitive along her backside.  Faith still has some odd skin bumps most likely from years of malnutrition.  Her back leg is also bent somewhat awkwardly, like a break that never healed properly.

Faith would be happy to just be in a home with a cozy bed and a peaceful environment.  She ignores other dogs and probably would be fine in a home with cats.  Because of her rough life, Faith is cautious around new people.  She allows us to pet her and put her in the car, but she is uncomfortable at the vet's office when being poked and prodded and will let a handler know if she is feeling threatened.   An ideal home for Faith would be one without small kids.

Sedona Shepherd would really like to find a foster home or foster to adopt situation.  A number of potential foster homes fell through once we agreed to bring her into our program.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting Faith, shoot us a request for more information at contact@sedonashepherd.com or fill out our adoption or foster form on line.

Please note:

Sedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes.  All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots

Our adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York.  We may adopt to Connecticut depending on circumstances.  Please visit our website at www.sedonashepherd.com.

Meet Chester, a 10-year-old Bully mix! This low-rider lived in a home until he was surrendered to shelter in August. We are so happy to help this AMAZING senior find his forever home!

He weighs 60 pounds and is a big hunk of love. He is 100% house trained and is not destructive when left alone. Chester is happiest snoozing on the couch - and snoring!

He is super food/treat motivated and eager to please.  Chester knows sit, come, leave it, wait, with me, and here--that big head is holding a big brain!

Chester tends to be a strong puller on-leash, but he is working hard to correct that with his foster mama. He LOVES belly rubs and will often invite you to do so (see picture #2).  Chester also loves being scratched on the neck.

His foster mama describes him as a very sweet boy and a good dog - easy!  

If you're looking to welcome a perfect, hunky senior into your home, look no further than Chester!

Navy and Pinto are 2-month-old Labrador Retriever mixes anxiously awaiting their forever homes here in New Jersey. They were originally rescued from Marion County, South Carolina and are very lucky to be alive. At the moment, they weigh all of about 7 pounds, however, they will likely be medium-large sized dogs once fully grown. Their foster moms say, \""These two pups are definitely the life of the party! They love to run and jump on each other playing. They are definitely attention lovers.\"" They are working very hard on their leash, crate, and house training skills. In no time, these smart pooches will be masters of all three!

Pinto is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped.

Home for Good Dog Rescue (HFGDR) is a 100 percent foster-based rescue located in Summit with offices in Berkeley Heights, NJ. All of our dogs live in loving local foster homes until they find forever families of their own. Our fosters begin basic training, housebreaking, and leash walking skills to help pair you with the perfect pup for life!

We update Petfinder and our website multiple times daily, so if a dog is available on Petfinder and our website they are still available for adoption. We process all our applications in the order we receive them, and for that reason sometimes the dog or dogs in whom you are interested in may be adopted before your own processing concludes.

In order to apply for adoption and set up an individual meet and greet with one of our dogs, please visit us at www.HomeforGoodDogs.org.

This ~10 year old mostly toothless tiny terrier mix was left behind when his elderly owners moved- literally?
They left him in the street instead of bringing him to a shelter.  Luckily a neighbor took them in and reached out to rescues.  Poor Steve hadnât seen a vet in many years and in addition to his rotting teeth, had a very large infected tumor on his hind end (common in older males who were never neutered). We will spare you the gruesome pics but heâs had surgery to remove it and happily it was benign and he is ready to start his new life!  Steve is only about 10lbs, very cheerful and spunky for an older guy and good with other dogs.  Email njwoof@cs.com to adopt Steve!

We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.  Please email njwoof@cs.com for the fastest response to make sure the dog you are interested in will be there.
To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions.

Daisy has the sweetest, most gentle temperament and loves to receive affection. She is 1 years old and fully grown at about 46 pounds. She is a Cattle Dog/Lab mix.

I do have separation anxiety so I really like it when someone is home with me. Since we would be home together, I love going for walks.

If you are looking for a pal, then I am your guy!!!

Meet TYSON! This 80lb + boxer is only 8.5 months old. He will most likely get to be 100 pounds. So if you were looking for a big boy this could be your guy.
Couple of things about Tyson that we want you to be aware of before you consider him for adoption. He has a very high prey drive, which means he chases cats, squirrels, etc and will do anything to get to them. Heâs a good jumper and if you have a yard it needs to be a 6 foot fence with all areas secured.

He goes into his crate but he needs help to except the crate. Tyson has a lot of energy and needs a lot of exercise he is not going to be a couch potato dog. Being he is eight months old he needs training both house and manners. He is used to ringing bells to let you know he has to go out. He lived with kids 8+.

He is one of the cutest and sweetest boys you could ever want to meet and he is dog friendly. But he needs an owner thatâs going to put the time into him now so as he grows he understands his boundaries and matters.

So if youâre ready to take on a boxer puppy and work with him to be the best dog he can be then reach out to Barbara at Barbara aboxer@gmail.com.

Note: You must be approved before meeting Tyson or any other dog in rescue. So if you were interested in adopting please submit your application at www.njboxerrescue.com and go through the approval process so that when the right dog comes along you will already be approved."

Would you like to foster a shelter dog? For more information, visit us at www.ShelterSurvivors.com

This gorgeous gentleman is Diesel!  He is about 3.5 years old and was found as a stray in Brooklyn.  He was a staff favorite due to his excellent behavior, and when we saw his handsome picture we knew we had to help him.

Diesel is in a foster home with four other dogs and absolutely adores them.  The behaviorist at the shelter told us he was especially \""dog savvy\"" and she was 100% correct, as he romps and plays with dogs of all sizes in his foster home.  He is very close to perfect - he also loves all humans, is crate trained (but does not need to be crated since he is extremely well behaved when left alone for up to 7 hours), and is completely housebroken.  He has proven to be great \""off leash\"" once he bonded with his foster family and would be a great walking or hiking companion.

Diesel enjoys chewing on nylabones, ripping up stuffed toys, fetching tennis balls, and treats!  He was a bit skinny when he first arrived, however his love of treats and food have helped him gain some weight.  He is very affectionate, and will lay on top of you or next to you when he wants to cuddle.  He is a big, goofy guy, and he makes his foster family laugh when he falls off the couch, trips over his feet, or stares at you with his big puppy eyes.  He enjoys running around and chasing the other dogs in the backyard.  

Diesel is about 60 pounds, neutered, up to date on all his shots, housebroken, crate trained, and microchipped.  He is a great all around dog, and we know he would make a wonderful addition to any loving family!

To adopt Diesel, fill out our online dog application , or download our Microsoft Word dog application and return it to sheltersurvivors@live.com. It will help expedite the process.

Meet Princess Penelope Grace! I was rescued as a stray in NY and I was extremely emaciated. My foster mommy did such a great job helping me gain weight and get me healthy again. I am 2 years old, spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, crate trained, leash trained, and house broken. My favorite past times are chewing on my nyla bones and chasing after a tennis ball! I absolutely love other dogs and my forever family must have at least one other dog for me to play with! I have never been around cats, I love everyone I meet- including kids, and I enjoy laying on the deck in the sun while I watch over the neighborhood. My foster mommy says my beautiful eyes will melt your heart. She gives me lots of cuddles and belly rubs, which are another favorite of mine!

If your family would like to provide me with the home I deserve, please complete the adoption application at http://www.bullmastiffrescuers.net.

WE DO NOT RESPOND TO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES.

Hello, my name is Lily.  My foster mom sometimes calls me Silly Lily or Lily Bily.  BRI rescued me and my sister from a puppy mill when I was just 6 months old. Thankfully they got to me before I had to start producing puppies. My foster mom has had me for a few months and she says it took me a long time to not be afraid. She says I play so well with her dogs that she wants me to go to a home with confident dogs that can continue to teach me that I donât have to be so afraid. 

It took me a long time to learn to go potty outside but my foster mom is happy to report that my accidents in the house are down to a minimum. She has taught me to be comfortable in a crate though at her house I donât spend a lot of time in there. She tries not to coddle me too much because she knows I have to learn to face the things that scare me. But I get to sleep in bed with her! I curl up in a ball at the foot of the bed and I feel so safe I sleep all night there.

Iâm calm in the household â though still fearful. Iâll run in the den when too much activity is going on and peek my head out to see if itâs safe. Foster mom says it will take a lot of time for me to be the confident dog she knows is in there. She tells me that there is a family that will be patient with me and let me learn at my own pace that I donât need to run away and hide.

I guess Iâm a bit of a mooch! I sit beside my foster mom and rest my head on her chair waiting for a snack to come my way.  Since Iâm on the skinny side, she lets me get away with it sometimes. 

Lily is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped and is heartworm negative. If your family would like to provide her with the home she deserves, please complete the adoption application at http://www.bullmastiffrescuers.net.

He is weary of new people at first and we honestly cannot blame him for that. This sweet boy wants so desperately to love and be loved that he does warm up to new people after a few minutes. Because of his fear, we do recommend a home without small children. He would do best in a quiet household with an active adult family, couple, or single person. He has a lot of pent up energy and has completely missed out on his puppyhood. He would love to be your jogging partner, loyal companion, and playmate. We have not introduced him to other dogs but he has not been reactive to them in passing. We are not sure about cats. He may do best in a household with a confident female to learn from and grow with. Karlo's ideal person would have experience with traumatized dogs and patience to help him build up his confidence."

***THIS A COURTESY POST*** Zeke is not in the care of Shelter Survivors at this time. Please contact us if you are interested in this handsome boy and we will put you in touch with his current owner.

Zeke is a big, fun, energetic, strong, almost three year old German Shepard/Boxer mix who loves to cuddle mostly because he thinks heâs a lap dog. Although heâs unaware of his size, he means well and just wants all the love and attention. Fully house trained as well as crate trained. Heâs very playful so he will jump up on you when heâs excited. He needs a big, fully fenced backyard (one of which we could not provide for him) to run around in to use up all his energy. He eats twice a day- morning and night. Weâre looking for a loving family who will treat him with the best intentions and affection and take him on outdoor adventures.

Neutered: only one ball was found

â Anyone willing to give her a furever home? While we have fallen in love with her, she's not going to be allowed to stay on APG. We have found her to be so loving and sweet. She gets in the tub for her bath by herself even though she's not crazy about it. She plays roughly so probably doesn't need to be around little ones. She's so soft and loves to be brushed every day. She's always near, at my feet, my side, my lap, my bed lol she has had no anxiety since being here. She's a beautiful soul. â

 Klondike is a beloved part of the Old Bridge Animal Shelter that has won the hearts of our staff and volunteers during his stay here. Although he may look tough and sound intimidating, he possesses the sweetest and most gentle heart a dog can have. Some qualities that make Klondike such a lovable and cherished dog is that he always calls for your attention, greets everyone with licks and kisses, is always excited to spend time with you, loves to run around and play with toys (especially stuffed animals), and is well behaved. We hope that he can find his forever home and we know heâll be a great part of a family.
Update vaccination and neutered

Need to know information for people who interesting or wants to adopt Klondike: he is friendly but very strong. Fenced yard is for energized and strong dog to get off their energy daily if owner canât take them for walk. Since he is very strong we do not want the family who had a young kids under age 13. He may knock them down. For Dog selective part due to we do not know who he really like(event thought he get along with our shelter dog, doesnât mean anything) so thatâs why we mark as seems like as dog selective so people can be more alert when they interesting on him.

Her owners said she is 13 years old though they had no vet records and our vet thinks she is much younger- sheâs in great shape and looks and acts like a 5 year old!  Sheâs having surgery this week to repair her cherry eyes and get spayed and will be ready for a home very soon!

Deacon is an adorable and lovable almost 6-month-old boy looking for his forever family.
We're not sure what Deacon's breed mix is, possibly a sheltie or maybe fox terrier blend? We are sure that âsweetâ and âcuteâ are not breed choices but should be. 
He is on the small size and probably will not get too big, maybe 35 pounds max.
He is 28 pounds now.
Deacon has a soft, short to medium coat. He is good for bathes, ear cleanings and nail clips.
He gets along well with other dogs because he's just a happy pup and welcomes any playmate. He also loves any human attention. Deacon would do well with another dog or as an only. He loves to play with balls and will keep himself busy with a one-doggy soccer game.
He was cat tested prior to coming into rescue and was reported he showed neither fear nor aggression towards the cats. Because he was so small and very young, he was kept in the cat room at the shelter.
Deacon is totally housebroken, walks ok on leash, rides fine in the car although any car rides for him he has been crated. He is also microchipped.
Yes, he is crate-trained. But, as a young pup, he shouldn't be left alone for long, extended periods of time. He does require potty breaks throughout the day. 
We would like a fenced yard for Deacon. 
We are currently taking applications for Deacon. If interested, please completely fill out the adoption application, which can be found on our website and return it via e-mail to:  ruffcollies@outlook.com
The process includes: interested party submitting the completed application, followed by rescue reviewing the application and references checked, the applicant will then be contacted by rescue; a visit will be scheduled for you to meet Deacon in his Warren county NJ foster home. 
Prior to finalizing the adoption, a home visit will be required by a collie rescue volunteer to the home of the perspective adopter. We are requesting that perspective adopters be within a reasonable travel distance, one hour / sixty minutes preferred of Deaconâs foster home.
Adoption fee is $300.
Thank you!!
UPDATE: Currently Deacon is being treated for a mild skin infection. Once he finishes his course of antibiotics, approximately the second week of October, he will then be able to move onto the loving family that deserves this special guy.

Both in excellent health. Their owner is being transferred out of the country so requested we begin to explore trying to find the perfect home for them together. 
One is very friendly and outgoing. The other will bark at strangers until he gets to know them and feels a level of trust. Then heâs a big, loving mush. Heâll need a few days.
They are very attached to each other, so I wouldnât consider splitting them up. 
They love taking leash walks and being nosey about whatâs going on in the neighborhood! A fenced yard in addition is also a plus for them but not a necessity, as long as they get enough daily outings.
They are not aggressive to other dogs but two males whoâve grown up together might be best off as their own pack. They are accustomed to having someone who is home with them most of the day. 
We canât test them with kids or cats, but I suspect with their high prey drive, it would be best to avoid placement with them. 
These guys are so special, but we realize it will take extra time to place a pair in any case. 
If you have questions or interest, please contact Erica Cerny at ecerny@optonline.net
Pictures will be posted later.

Heâs black in color but has silver sprinkled throughout now that heâs an older guy. He still has lots of energy and is a happy, friendly and loving guy. His family vet just checked him out and feels heâs in very good shape health-wise!
He is up to date on his vaccines and on heartworm preventive, as well as having had bloodwork done. 
Leroyâs owner is now in very poor health and canât take care of him going forward. 
He should be an only dog. Heâs friendly to people and weâre told even loves children, however we would not place our adult rescues with very young children or babies. 
He is reportedly housebroken but accustomed to being in a kennel run type of situation much of the time, so someone who is retired or works from home and can get him out regularly, would be ideal. 
Must be a home owner for Leroy, not an apartment- heâs used to space and country. 
If you think you might be interested in sharing your life with Leroy for the rest of his life, please contact Erica Cerny at ecerny@optonline.net or 973-361-6790.
His location is northern VA and you would need to meet him in person at his home. 
We are helping the family find his forever home.

This is a more personal insight from Leroyâs family -
Meet Leroy. An ex-champion show dog, this little guy loves going for walks almost as much as he enjoys dinner. He's got a motivated swagger that will keep pace with anyone who walks beside him. He loves the outdoors and finds solace sitting in the shade of any tree he can find. 

You'll find him frequently smiling and a simple glance his way will get his tail wagging instantly.

His only faults come with an intact male instinct. Although housebroken, he likes to claim territories as his own. With a little attention and verbal notice, he should stay obedient. 

Although he may get along with other dogs, it's recommended he find a home where he can be lone king of the castle. He's not fond of being alone for too long and thunder scares him.

Overall he will make any family complete and will forever be devoted to the next family loving enough to welcome him in.

Poki is a mixed breed (Pit, Shepard) - rescued from the Carribean. He is neutered  - in October 2018. He is also micro chipped. Fully up to date on all his vaccinations. Very well cared for. 

Poki loves to run around with tennis balls, frisbees - he loves having his ears rubbed and scratched. Poki does best in a home with no children, he is greedy for all the love and attention :)
Playing fetch is a favorite thing and he hasn't seen or smelled food that he won't devour. Poki is housetrained, can sit and give paw for his treats

Haley is a 4 year old 50 pound dog who was surrendered to a shelter in New York by her family because she was not interacting well with the other animals in the house, and the owners feared for the safety of their cat, lizard and rabbits.  She did not do well playing with another dog,  She can be excitable, but does walk fairly well on a leash.  We think she will do well as an only pet in a home.  Due to her exuberance, we would be hesitant to place her in a home with small children.

Meet Kendall. Kendall is beautiful and really special, and glad to be part of our rescue. Now it's time for her to find her forever home. She's a 7 month old Lab mix who is adorable and nearly perfect. This special gal came to us via our rescue partners in Kuwait, and boy are we glad to have her.

Kendall is all puppy. She loves to romp and play with other dogs, has met and been fine with kids over 8, loves toys, treats, food and snacks. She loves not living on the streets, cuddles, and toys that squeak. 

Kendall is working on house breaking, is fine in a crate, and doesn't mind a family whose adults go to work. Her ideal home would have another young dog for her to play with, a fenced in yard, toys, food, and love. 

She is beautiful, silly and fun. Kendall is ready for you to adopt her. 

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/, then email Corey@bigfluffydogs.com for more information on this amazing dog.

NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. 

All known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there."

You may not know it, but you might have a BEAGLE to thank for your medicines! Beagles are used for safety testing of human and veterinary medicines for the same reasons that they make good pets; they're small and gentle-natured.

It gives us and you a chance to give back to these sweet dogs that have contributed to the advancement of science. Please email us if you're ready to be a giant hero in the eyes of a little dog!

1. Fill out an application found at www.happypawsrescue.org under the *ADOPT* tab.

5. We generally adopt to families within a 1-hour radius of our home base in Piscataway, NJ but may consider farther distances in the tri-state region if volunteers are available. If you live beyond our geographical boundaries, we hope you will contact rescue organizations closer to your home.

Mickey is a handsome well behaved 5 year old boxer mix.  He was surrendered because his owner could not care for him.  He has been staying at a local animal hospital, and the staff there has fallen in love with him.  He is a big guy - 79 pounds, but he knows all kinds of commands, is very quiet and likes to be around people.  He can be a little unhappy with other dogs, but he was in a room with a few other dogs and had no reaction.  He had a tumor on his leg which was removed and the biopsy came back fine, so he us ready to mesmerize you into falling in love with his big brown eyes. We had an email from his former owners saying he had bit a child, we have tried to contact them for information about the bite, but they have not responded to our calls or emails so we do not know what really happened.

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

She is very shy with new people and will need a quiet, patient home to work on this with her. With other dogs, Shea is described as pushy and a bit of a bully so we are not sure if she'd like to live with another dog. Due to her shyness, she cannot live with children under 16.

Shea loves swimming, fetch, snuggles, and belly rubs.

Inspite of a difficult start in life Big Love shows so much enthusiasm and love for life. He loves everyone he meets and continues to inspire love in your heart.

Big Love is a Indian Pariah pup rescued from the streets of Chandigarh when he was hit by a car. We tried to save his leg with a pinning surgery which was unfortunately unsuccessful. However who gets around just fine on his three legs...he can run, jump and climb up and down the stairs. His favorite activity is playing with his doggy friends and cuddling with his humans. 

He is a healthy and happy puppy around 5 months old who weighs about 25 pounds. He has all his puppy vaccinations and also microchipped. He is a smart pup who is doing well with his training too.

If you have it in your heart to give this sweet pup a loving home please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com for an adoption application.

Information on the Indian Pariah Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

45695655,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/darla-45695655/nj/pottersville/bullmastiff-rescuers-nj786/?referrer_id=87b31e7d-4508-41d1-95ff-fdb59b9d4669,Dog,Bullmastiff,False,Red / Chestnut / Orange,Adult,Female,Extra Large,Short,True,True,True,Darla,Pottersville,NJ,07979,"PLEASE READ THE COMPLETE BIO AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION (available at www.bullmastiffrescuers.net under Forms) BEFORE CONTACTING US.  WE DO NOT RESPOND TO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES.

Darla was rescued in the spring from puppy mill life. She was very timid and found it hard to trust people but after a few months in rescue, she has blossomed. Her foster home has two bullmastiffs and a dachshund that she gets along with great. She has a wonderful time playing with them in the back yard and exploring.  She trots from one side of the yard to the other with her tail wagging and tongue out. She also loves exploring the garden and finding fresh veggies to eat. She is particularly fond of cucumbers.

Darla has learned a lot from the resident dogs and we would like to place her in a home with another dog so she can continue to have the doggie companionship she enjoys so much. It took a long time for Darla to get comfortable taking treats or seek attention from humans but she made steady progress trusting humans. She is sweet dog with an excellent temperament and a quick learner. Darla has been learning basic commands, is crate trained and reliably house broken. Her new family will need to continue with training and be patient and encouraging when she shows her timid side. 

Darlaâs ideal day consists of rising early and having playtime outside with the dogs before it gets too hot.  Throughout the day she is content laying under the table behind her foster momâs desk and playing with her toys. In the evening she wants to play in the den or outside. Before bed she wants her daily snuggle time with her foster dad. One of her favorite activities is to play ring around the patio table with her foster mom when her foster mom is trying to get her inside. She has a mischievous side. 

As with many dogs rescued from puppy mill life, Darla has a tendency to chew and ingest things she shouldnât â socks, small toys, etc.  Dog toys need to be appropriately sized for bullmastiffs so she canât swallow them.  Because of this tendency, it would be best for Darla to not go to a home with children under 5. She is great with the older kids in her foster home but a home with small children and all the toys and clutter that come with having toddlers would be too tempting for her.

Darla was two years old in February. She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations and on heartworm preventative.  

If your family would like to provide Darla with the home she deserves, please complete the adoption application at http://www.bullmastiffrescuers.net. She is being fostered in Mississippi; however, donât let location be a barrier. If you think Darla is the bullmastiff for your family, BRI can arrange transport through our network of volunteers!"

Come meet DONALD the Jack Russell Terrier mix!  He is small and cute with those soulful puppy dog eyes.  He is a 4-year-old boy who loves to go on walks. He is very independent, but he likes to be around people. He is not a lap dog or the cuddly type, but he definitely likes to be around you.  

He is playful, but he tends to get a little nippy so he would do best in an all-adult home with no children.  The right home would be a dog-savvy single person or couple (without other pets) that would be willing to put in the time for training preferably a trainer who would come to the house.  So, he definitely is not for a first-time dog adopter.

He had a rough start in life and came to the shelter with health problems due to being very, very skinny.  We have been providing him with a lot of TLC, and now he is becoming healthier every day and has put on some weight.  Because he was so thin, food is ALWAYS on his mind.  When he goes on walks....his main goal is to look for food.  Even though he is well-fed, he is ALWAYS in search of food.  So, you would need to make a commitment to keep inside garbage cans/pails secured so he can't get to them. You would also have to make a commitment to keep away any kind of people food on coffee tables or somewhere that he is able to reach.  He is on a strict special diet right now that needs to be followed (vet's orders).  

He has a vet appointment in September to be neutered.  So, he will have to come back in September to our vet to be neutered.

All of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered (he has an appt. in Sept.) microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption.

Romeo was found as a stray in NY.  We know how he got his name, since he is such a lover boy!  He is a sweet, quiet mellow dog with flowing black silky hair.  He loves to give kisses, play with his toys, take walks or just snuggle next to you.  He is 8 years old & weighs 19 lbs.  Like most shih tzus, he does have dry eye so will need eye drops.  He is a great friendly happy dog who gets along with other dogs & cats.  He is patiently waiting for his forever home (& maybe even his Juliet!) and will make a great addition to any family.

She has lived
with a family but she will be at her best with a single person or couple.
She lives presently with 10 dogs and is submissive with them.  She is really
playful and loves the company of dogs.  She is an affectionate sweet heart
of a girl.  Loves to sleep in your bed at night.  She is playful but can be
chill and quiet as well.  She is utterly adorable.      Darla is already
spayed, microchipped, fully vaccinated, and tested negative for heartworms.
She is    Gentle and fun-loving and  she is fostering in Norwalk, CT.  She
would do best with a doggie companion as she loves to play.  She can be calm
and then puppy playful.  She is a good girl.  Looks like a Frenchie! Looks
like a Seal!  Very beautiful and unusual faint brindle coloring.  Darla is
amazingly well-behaved.  She is housebroken and can entertain herself but
then looks for a rough housing session with her sibling doggies. She found
her sea legs and runs like the wind.  She is very trainable.  She is not
willful at all.  She snores through the night.  Loves to cuddle and then
passes out immediately.  She will be a true medium-sized dog. Very adorable
and truly such a good girl.  Had 10 days of professional training.  I can
show you her training video!  Like all dogs I recommend a trainer on
adoption to lay the foundation for a happy life.  She was SO GENTLE with a 5
pound Chihuahua.  Ask me for those videos.  She is shy/timid around new
people and that is what she needs to work on.  But her temperament and
disposition are perfect.  If you give this girl a chance and come to
interview her and be patient, she will give you a lifetime of devotion and
loyalty. She is very low maintenance.  Does not need to have leash walks,
she's happy in the garden.  She never leaves my property and just hangs with
the dogs and cats and is happy as a clam.  Darla is being fostered in Rowayton, CT.  Please contact Jennifer Gordon at 203-246-4681.

This adorable boy is Onyx. Him and his 10 siblings were surrendered to a high-kill shelter back in May in Amarillo, Tx at just 11 wks old as part of their spay-a-mom program. 2 of them were adopted locally, but we got the rest of them out so we could assure them a better life than what their siblings are going to have, sadly. The 5 of the remaining puppies were picked up & placed with great fosters, the boys however had to be boarded at a local vet until we could find someone to take them. Unfortunately they came down with Parvo due to being at a vet that handles a lot of parvo cases. We believe Kyan & Onyx were false positives, because he never showed signs of parvo. Onyx is now 6 mos old, fully vaccinated, microchipped, crate trained, and just about housebroken. Onyx is great with other dogs, he was fine with cats a couple of mos ago, but has not been exposed to them since he's been in Tx. He is great with kids, and oh and he likes water too (it's the Lab in him!). He so deserves to having a loving family, would you like that to be your family???

We do not have a shelter facility you can visit.  Our volunteers foster the dogs and pups in their homes once they have been vetted and transported here to NJ.

Please read our homepage www.fhdr.petfinder.com to read how the adoption process works. And, please visit Furever Home Dog Rescue's homepage www.FureverHomeDogRescue.com to see some of our many reviews.  Thank you!"

Meet Roscoe! This smart boy knows basic commands and is looking for a family to teach him more. He loves to play fetch, is housebroken, and will cuddle up on the couch to watch TV with you. He gets along well with cats, and some dogs on a case by case basis. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and ready to become part of your family!

If you're interested in adopting Roscoe, please first read about our adoption process under the *ADOPT* tab at www.happypawsrescue.org. Then, complete an adoption application found under the same tab and email it to happypawsrescue@gmail.com. Roscoe will be at our adoption day events on SUNDAYS from 12-3 p.m. at the Piscataway, NJ Petco. Thank you for your interest in adopting!

***Let us introduce you toâ¦ the American Shelter Dog! When we look at dogs of unknown parentage, such as this beautiful pup, the best we can do is guess at their breed, and it turns out that even dog experts are usually wrong when doing so. Itâs been shown that nearly 90 percent of shelter dogs visually identified as a particular breed/mix are mislabeled. Please understand that it is impossible to reliably identify the breed(s) or predict the behavior of dogs solely on the basis of their appearance. Though we may not know their blend, we do know that the love of a rescued dog is without boundaries and touches all those in its reach, often transforming the rescuee into the rescuer!***

Thinking about adopting me? Hereâs how:
1. Fill out an application found at www.happypawsrescue.org under the *ADOPT* tab. 
2. Email it to happypawsrescue@gmail.com.
3. Please allow a few days for us to review and respond to your application. 
4. Approved applicants will be invited to come meet me at adoption day.
5. We generally adopt to families within a 1-hour radius of our home base in Piscataway, NJ but may consider farther distances in the tri-state region if volunteers are available. If you live beyond our geographical boundaries, we hope you will contact rescue organizations closer to your home.
6. If both you and the rescue agree that I'm a good fit for your home, you will fill out an adoption contract. The adoption fee is $300 for dogs. 
7. We have lots of fun together!"

Mika is known as our \""Foxy Lady.\""Â Â  Her big bushy tail, enchanting face, and energetic personality makes us think of the Jimi Hendrix song, Foxy Lady.Â  Mika is all about enjoying life and exploring as many nooks and crannies inside and outside as she possibly can find. Â  Mika is between 1-3 years old and mostly Husky with a dash of German Shepherd. Â She will come right up to new people and greet them with a friendly tail wag and maybe even a quick little kiss.Â  She has a typical husky personality, inquisitive, playful, and always ready to go for a run.Â  Her shepherd side shines through with her attentiveness, intelligence, obedience, and willingness to bond and be your best friend and .

Put Mika in a large fenced in area with another dog and she will have a blast.Â  Mika is extremely fast and can run circles around most other dogs.Â  Mika does have a high prey drive, so hold on tight if there are squirrels around and no cats for this girl. Â  Inside the home, Mika is trustworthy and loves to toss around a tug toy or tennis ball.Â  She would do best with an active family or active young couple, or single person. Â  Based on her activity level, she would be best in homes with children over 7 years of age but she is gentle enough to meet smaller children.Â  Mika is healthy, happy and ready to run with her new pack.

Although we do not normally require a fenced in yard, any applicants with a secured fenced in yard will be given greater consideration.Â  If you are interested in fostering or adopting Mika, shoot us a request for more information at contact@sedonashepherd.com or fill out an adoption application form.

Sedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes.  All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots

Our adoption area includes New Jersey, Delaware Valley, Manhattan, Southern New York.  We may adopt to Connecticut depending on circumstances.  Please visit our website at www.sedonashepherd.com.

She is an 8 year old, 8 pound Chihuahua who was spotted running alone for several days on a busy city street.  Finally, a Good Samaritan managed to catch her.  It appeared that poor little Courtney may have been abandoned and clearly had not been well cared for. Her teeth were in bad shape requiring three extractions, and she was suffering from an abscess that needed treatment.  But, after thorough vetting, Courtney is now a healthy, happy little gal living in a private foster home where sheâs receiving lots of TLC. 

This spunky little cutie is house trained and faithfully uses the doggy door in her foster home.  She has free run of the house and loves being able to sleep with her foster mom and dad.  Snuggling under blankets (regardless of the weather) and cuddling on any available lap are two of her favorite things.  She tends to be a bit of a picky eater, which is probably how she keeps her girlish figure.  Donât you love those ears! 

Courtney gets along well with the other dogs, though, typical of her breed, she can be a bit bossy and will let them know when she thinks theyâre having too much funâ¦sometimes loudly - LOL. There are no children in her foster home, but a toddler has visited and she paid no attention.  We think her ideal life would be with a retired person or couple where sheâll be queen of her domain.  She has not been observed around cats, but would likely be fine with a dog-savvy kitty.

Courtney is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.  Sheâs move-in ready and hoping to hear that thereâs a forever home with a comfy lap just waiting for her.  If youâd like to give her the happily ever after that she deserves, please contact Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net for an application.  Her adoption fee is $300.

With Scooter, it is guaranteed that he will ride his way into your heart! He is a 2-year old Boston Terrier who is a fun-loving boy with a stellar personality.

Besides the hysterical snorts and snoring, Scooter will never fail to entertain you with his goofy antics.  Whether it involves doing 'zoomies' in the backyard or being clumsy, he will bring a smile to your face everyday. 

Just as much as he is a goofball, Scooter is also a total sweetheart. There is nothing like coming home from work and seeing Scooter's entire body wiggle with joy. He then wants nothing more than to cover your face in kisses! 

Looking to get in shape? Scooter will happily be your workout buddy! He would love to go hiking, jogging, or take long walks in the neighborhood! 

He is house broken and crate trained. Scooter wouldnât mind living with other dogs as long as there is a proper introduction! He takes some time to get comfortable with their presence but once he does, he is more than happy to play and lounge with them. Scooter is working hard on his leash training and looks forward to working on it everyday. Scooter would be fine living with kids above the age of 16. 

Scooter needs a home that will provide him with proper structure and exercise which will allow him to thrive. He is a very loving dog but needs guidance to turn him into the perfect gentleman that we know he can become. 

If you are interested in adopting Scooter, please fill out an application on our website www.wiseanimalrescue.org/adoption-application!

These pictures may not look like a big deal, but since he came to us terrified and not letting us touch him when we first pulled him from the pound, these pics show a huge transformation!  Young Ralphie has transformed into a happy playful cuddly guy with his foster mom.  Dogs like him are the most rewarding to foster or adopt- while it is harder to find someone to look past the initial fear, earning their love and trust makes it so much more special.  
It probably wonât be love at first sight and he wonât jump up and give you kisses when you first meet him (or greet your visitors happily), but the love and loyalty he shows his chosen people is worth the extra effort.  He does seem to have a possessive streak over furniture and his chosen people and might be better in a home with just one person and someone who understands when to respect his space.  Ralphie is about 2 years old, maybe younger, neutered, updated on shots and about 15lbs full grown.  We think he is a chiweenie, maybe with some Pom mixed in to give him his curly tail, and and he has been getting along well with other dogs in his foster home. 
Email njwoof@cs.com to meet little Ralphie! We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.   To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions  For the fastest response please email njwoof@cs.com if you are interested in one of our dogs..

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

Please visit our Face book page to see the IN dogs adopted through our rescue.

Jack is fully vaccinated, microchipped and has a blood and stool test report and an International health certificate. He is a smart pup who is doing well on house breaking, crate and leash training.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

This pup is sweet as a raisin. He is around 4 months old Indian Pariah pup who was rescued from the streets of India as a orphaned pup. It would have been very hard for Kishmish and his siblings to survive without their Mother's protection on their own on the brutal streets. All his siblings died getting run over by cars...Kishmish, Zippy and Piggu are the sole survivors of their litter. Piggu already found a great home and Kishmish is hoping a family will come and adopt him too. 

Kishmish is fully vaccinated, microchipped and has a blood and stool test report and an International health certificate. 

In India Kishmish had no chance at adoption but in the U.S. we know that a loving family will adopt him. If you have it in your heart to give this sweet dog a chance of having a good life please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com for an adoption application. 

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

He came to us as an owner surrender as his owners did not really know what they were getting and thought he was the functional equivalent of a white golden retriever. This is not a retriever kind of dog.

Duke is a very good boy. He is mellow, well-behaved and good with people. He has excellent indoor manners and he is generally very well-behaved. He is great on the leash and he is good in the car and loves going for car rides. 

Duke is OK with dogs that are not in his face and don't want to dominate him. He doesn't mind when dogs are around him and he is pretty chill until they get in his face or touch him as he likes his space. He did fall in love with a 4 month old dane puppy, but overall, we think he is just happiest on his own.  He is a little too interested in the cats and chases them for fun, so we think a non-cat home is best. He is not trustworthy off leash as is typical for the breed and he needs a securely fenced yard. 

Duke is an excellent example of a classic Great Pyrenees and for those that know and love the breed he's perfect. He is watchful, respectful and also, selectively deaf when you call him to come in. Kids over 10 would be best.  This is the perfect dog for someone who wants just one woolly mammoth dog and wants one who is low energy.

All known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there."

Before you begin falling in love, ask yourself this question: Am I a marshmallow? If the answer is yes, this is not your dog. Skip to Cynthia and adopt her.

Dax came to us as an owner surrender. Not to put too fine a point on it, his owners were idiots. They attempted to keep him in the yard with an electric fence and succeeded in shocking the bejeezus out of him with the collar. Dax is a friendly dog, and when he would see people, he would rush to see them, get shocked, and then freak out, thus freaking out the people who saw a barking giant dog running at them and then acting like he was having a seizure. Electric fences are bad things and needless to say, he was surrendered to us.

As the result of his experiences, Dax is not a dog I will put in a first time dog owner's home. While he is out on the leash, he's fine with people and dogs he meets. He will probably always be a touch of a barker when people invade his barriers because he still expects to get shocked every time he sees new people. We think with time, this will fade. He is absolutely a love in the home with his people and he is a great dog. 

Dax will chase squirrels and thinks that cats are snacks, so he needs a home with no cats or small animals. He is not the dog for first time pyr owners and he will only be placed in a home with a secure privacy fence. We think that he would be best placed in a  quiet home with another dog to play with and for him to learn how to be a normal dog from.  Dax is house trained and perfectly well mannered. Kids over 12 please with this dog.

You are probably wondering why Big Fluffy Dog Rescue has a greyhound mix, and truth be told, me too. That said, this is an amazing dog and whoever dropped him at the shelter is missing out on an awesome dog.

Connor knows a million commands. He can sit, lay down, shake and so many other things. He walks perfectly on a leash and rides like a champ in the car. He is fantastic with people and has never met a stranger. He is also  house trained and doesn't mind being in a crate. The only thing he does not like is being poked by a vet and I kind of don't blame him. He didn't even get taken out to dinner first before the themometer was used in a rather invasive manner.  

Connor is dog friendly but is much more interested in people than dogs. He would do fine placed with other dogs or as an only if someone without dogs just fell in love with him.  Connor is not good with cats and needs to be placed in a home that does not have cats. He would be best placed with active people because he loves walks and being outside. He is a sight hound which means he will chase small woodland creatures and he would be best in a fenced yard.

Say hello to MARCUS! He is a gorgeous young Shepherd mix who came in as a stray. He is approximately 1.5 years old with lots of energy. He is a very strong dog, so his new owner must be strong. And, the plus is that he listens well. He must go to an EXPERIENCED Shepherd adopter. 

He definitely does NOT do well with other male dogs, so, he will need to be the only male dog in the home or the only pet. Also, he needs to be kept away from other male dogs while going for a walk. He should be okay with calm female dogs. A meet and greet is required, of course. No cats, no kids and no small pets. He needs training, so his new family/adopter will need to make a commitment and put in the time to train him. 

As with all shelter pets, he will need time to decompress. Again, he will make a great family member in an experienced shepherd owner's home.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. 

Our goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicantâs ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.

Justice has quickly gone from being a hard luck story to well on his way to happily ever after! Still a young boy, this sweet guy came in to rescue starved and nearly hairless. Now his fur is returning and he is quickly becoming the handsome dog he was meant to be. Justice is currently around 65 lbs and will probably need some extra meals and snacks (big cookie fan here!) to help him fill out as he continues to grow. Other than some extra food breaks Justice is a pretty basic all around good boy. He loves meeting and playing with new people and dogs. He didnât mind spending time with a cat and even did well being around a parrot. Justice also absolutely loves toys, especially ones that you can tear apart :) He is currently working on crate training and walking on a leash and has nearly mastered the âsitâ command.

She's about 7-8 years old and cute as a button!!  She's a pocket pointer, maybe a GSP/EP mix?  We can't say for certain but she's a doll. When she's curious, she has the cutest little ears that \""pop up\"".   

She weighs about 33 lbs.  Lola was adopted out through our program a few years ago and unfortunately her family had to move and couldn't take her with them, so she's back with our rescue.

Here's a little info from her foster parents on what type of home she would like:

Lola is a sweet girl who does well with other dogs & kids but really has no interest in playing. She is very happy just hanging out with you curled up on the couch or her bed. She shows no interest in toys at all. She does well on walks will pull at times but can be redirected. She most definitely needs a fenced in yard as she will make a run for it. She is fine left alone and really does not need to be crated. Bottom line she's an easy girl who just wants a home  where she can hang out & be loved.

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

Please visit our Face book page to see the IN dogs adopted through our rescue.

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

Thank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!"

He was so scared and shy.  He quickly ended up on the Euthanasia list where one of our amazing fosters stepped up to save him.


Laker's STATS:

Approximate age             3/4 years old	
Approximate weight       55lb         
Breed (s)           lab/shepherd/pit
Spayed or neutered?     neutered

Good with:       
kids?         older
strangers?          yes
other dogs?            yes
cats?        not tested
On leash?     walks very well on the leash
Housetrained?              yes 
Crate trained?           yes       
Paper trained?           n/a

Oh Laker, where do we begin? When Laker first arrived at our house, he was a nervous wreck.  Simply petting him on his head seemed like something new for him, he was very unsure of It! As the days went by, he warmed up to the Idea of being loved and now that's all he wants from his human(s).  Laker will entertain himself for hours if left with a toy or bone.   Laker is a very quiet dog, when we put him in his room for the night, or when we leave for work, he makes himself comfortable in his bed right away without making a peep (unlike our other dogs that go crazy)! Laker Is a low maintenance dog that only wants to be loved! 


Preferred forever home for your foster?
A home that will shower him with love and give him tons of head scratches! He does not need a fenced yard, he prefers to lay on the deck rather than run around, so going for walks through out the day makes him happy.  A house with dog experience Is preferred because of his cautious nature when It comes to new things.  


Interesting quirks/behaviors:
Sits when he sees his food bowl, very playful,  doesn't bark, doesn't have separation anxiety, loves to play with other dogs! Laker Is a very good listener, he'll sit without having to ask twice, he'll come when called without hesitation, he lays down and puts his head down If he's told no.  He Is one smart cookie! He jumps right Into the car and does very well In the car as well! 

Issues:     he's working on his confidence, he's weary of new things, but quickly warms up

Elton â 2-3 year old male, (fully vetted HW negative) 
Elton is an active guy who loves playing with his tennis and soccer balls. He is a bit of a vocal little dude, but is a cuddle bug with humans.

Elton will need a dog savvy owner, as he can be a bit territorial of his kennel/space from passing dogs. Elton currently has a best bud named Allie, but he does not do well with male dogs. He would do well as an only dog or with a friendly female large dog.

Speedy is healthy, but had acute lameness in his hind-end with a presumed diagnosis of meningomyelitis most likely caused by a spinal infarction (MRI done) at the end of 2017 and, although he can run and play and handle a few steps, he healed with an ankylosed spine  (curvature of his spine to the right, basically scoliosis as viewed on x-rays, with no degenerative remodeling or IV disc disease). It is therefore recommended that Speedy not jump or do full sets of stairs â he is not in pain and is not on any medication. He also has some muscle atrophy in his hind-end which exercise would be beneficial for.

Speedy is described by his current owner as a very sweet, gentle, dog who tends to prefer a quiet environment â he does not like âchaos and loud noise.â A home without young children is requested, although he is good with people, including children.  Accustomed to living with another Italian Greyhound, Speedy would do fine in a home with another small dog. Since he currently has a fenced yard which he enjoys running in, a fenced yard in his new home would be ideal. In addition, his current owner worked from home and is currently home except for medical treatment, so a home where Speedy is not left for long work hours is requested.

Eight-years old and weighing 11.5 pounds, Speedy is not a highly active dog, but does enjoy running in an enclosed area, being outside, and going for walks. Heâs not a fan of most toys, but loves to chew and tear paper apart, likes to de-stuff plush toys, and will play with some plastic/rubber toys. He loves sitting and being with his person (or people), enjoys car rides, is good on-leash (very little pulling), doesnât tend to bark much (when he is hungry or wants to go outside to potty), and is crate trained, although his owner uses an exercise pen or kitchen, dining area, and hallway when he needs to be left alone (he can be destructive with shoes, throw pillows and paper items when left alone and the owner, therefore, limits his space). He cannot get onto furniture such as sofas by himself, but needs to be supervised if sitting with someone so that he does not jump off and hurt himself.  Speedy has previously lived with cats.

Speedy is house trained to potty outside and to use doggy pee pads and has very few accidents â only if he is not taken out or his request to go out is missed.

He has spent a few days, both previously and more recently, at his primary veterinarian facility (for veterinarian procedures) and his veterinarian has indicated that Speedy is a very happy, outgoing, dog who loves to run around and enjoy himself, and that the curvature of Speedyâs spine does not impact his enjoyment and quality of life.

In 2017, Speedy had a mast cell tumor removed (grade 1 with clean margins) and an echo-cardiogram done (stage B1 heart murmur), with a second echo-cardiogram done in 2019 (stage B1). He has also had two dental cleanings, with some extractions - in 2017 and 2019. 

If you might be interested in providing Speedy with his new home and can accommodate his jumping/stair restrictions, please contact Italian Greyhound Place.

Blaze comes from a shelter in New York.  He was an owner surrender, the shelter evaluation said he was good with other dogs, walks well on a leash and loves to play fetch with a tennis ball.   We brought him to his first adoption event and he was great.  He is could use a little work on pulling, but he was friendly and respectful of everyone, knows several tricks, loves watermelon, and does love to play fetch. If you are looking for a smart well behaved 85 pound friend, Blaze would be fantastic.

This feisty but cute little guy was saved from death row a couple of times...the rescue who originally âsavedâ him was going to return him to the shelter to be euthanized when he showed barrier aggression upon arrival, but a rescue friend reached out to us as a last ditch effort to save him.  He was very defensive at first but once he bonds heâs a cuddly playful sweetheart!  The caring kennel staff at our vet Animal Clinic of Morris Plains spent a lot of extra time during his stay there getting him to trust them so his true personality could shine through his initial fears.  Ollie is about 5-6 years old and gets along with most other dogs, weighs 12lbs and we think he may be a min pin/Yorkie or Schnauzer mix?  Oh, and he has the cutest little natural Mohawk!

He is really good with other dogs and is super excitable with every person he meets. His ideal household would be an active one as he definitely has a lot of energy to burn. Theo would either like to have a big fenced in yard to run around in or a family who will take him for long walks, jogs, runs and hikes... or better yet, both! Perhaps a furry playmate to run and play with would help him to get out some of that puppy energy he still has. At this time, Theo prefers not to live with cats or small children.

Billy and Molly were neglected abandoned and found by one of our volunteers .  They are both very sweet dogs who have been to the vet, given shots, and are typical beagles.  Billy can be spooked.  While recently adopted, he spooked and ran away.  He was quite content to hang out in the neighborhood, and eat the cat food left out on a local golf course.  Due to his superior escape artist abilities, we will only adopt him to a family with extensive beagle experience, and a fenced in back yard.  He does get along with other dogs and gets some extra courage from them.  He is sweet, but can be a handful when on the run!

We rescued this sweet girl from AHS-Newark Branch today and she went straight to our vet for much needed medical care and answers to why sheâs in the condition that sheâs in. We still donât have many answers, other than that she most likely had some kind of trauma, or a possible tumor on her spine (she would need more tests), that is affecting her legs and causes her to wobble, and occasionally fall over. We don't yet have an answer of why she isn't gaining weight either, so hopefully her bloodwork tells more. She was full of worms and has a uti, and is currently on meds. All we do know is she's as sweet as can be and she's in need of a foster! Please apply at pittiesandpals.com to foster Mila. 
A huge thank you to Terri and Brian for their generous donations, and the rockstar volunteers for advocating for Miss Mila!

Mila will get you whatever testing and care is needed, so any amount you can donate is greatly appreciated !"

She originally came from a hoarding case with 20 of her closest friends. She was also very pregnant when we rescued her and successfully gave birth to 2 puppies, who have both gone on to their forever homes. Now it is her turn!

Dana was not well-socialized due to the circumstances of her early life, so she is still quite shy around people. She enjoys following you around the house to watch what you're doing, will come when called, and walks nicely on leash. She will need someone patient who will give her the time to adjust and earn her trust. 

Dana LOVES other dogs and a home with another confident four-legged playmate is a must for her. She loves playing and running zoomies around the yard, so a securely fenced yard would be a huge bonus. Dana has also lived with cats and parrots and ignores both.

Given her background, we think a home without young children is best. Older kids over 10 who understand that they need to allow her to approach them on her own terms would be just fine! Dana would love a quieter household without a lot of comings and goings. She is housebroken and crate trained.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please FIRST apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/
Our Website www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the adoption process. If you still have questions, you can reach out to corey@bigfluffydogs.com.

NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBER WE GET DAILY. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. 

* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!

BUNNY - Very Sweet!,Edison,NJ,08817,"A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT MS. BUNNY! 
SHE LOVES BUTT SCRATCHES! 

ADOPT ME!  Say hello to Ms. Bunny! Oh my goodness! Those ADORABLE EARS!! She is a young (approx. 1-1/2 year old) terrier mix.  She is very sweet, loves to go for walks and is a nice energy.  She would do best with older children as the only pet. One of our volunteers has been working on basic commands with Ms. Bunny to get her ready for her new home!

All of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption.

This shy girl is still a puppy at heart, only about a year old and once she feels safe turns into a normal playful girl with her people and doggie friends!
She survived on her own on the streets of Philly for at least several months, hanging around a construction site where kind people fed her.  She was too scared to approach and had to be trapped by our new friends @ Team Louie Animal Rescue to get her to safety.  

Once in a temporary foster with someone who helped in her capture it quickly became evident she grew up with little to no human contact- she panicked on a leash or being touched and needed time and patience to learn to trust.  

We love our âferalâ project dogs at Second Chance and since coming to us her true funny personality has quickly emerged in her foster home with the help of her more confident dog friends.  She is quite the clown and loves to play with toys, wrestle, chase, and be chased by other dogs, and now even wags her tail and solicits petting from her foster mom!  While she still is scared of new people and places, she makes progress each day and we know in the right home she has so much potential.  

What does Maybeâs ideal home look like?  

A calmer adult household with just one or 2 patient people who can earn her trust and love.  At least one other playful dog her size or larger (45-50lbs) for her to play with and learn from. A securely fenced yard to ensure she never ends up on the run and fending for herself again. And someone who will love her and accept that while she may never be a social butterfly with strangers she has such a fun lovable personality if you are lucky enough to be in her inner circle of friends!

Email njwoof@cs.com to learn more about Maybe if you think maybe your home could be the right fit for her!

View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.

Our goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicantâs ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.

Kirchner is my name and fun is my game! Kirchner is a 3-year-old Great Pyrenees mix, possibly with golden retriever. This sweet boy came into rescue as a stray and extremely underweight at 38 pounds. Although he is on the small size, we believe, once healthy he will be closer to 70 pounds. Despite his past, this boy is always smiling, happy to be alive and doesnât know a strangerâhuman or animal. He gets along great with small and large dogs, both male and female and doesnât seem to mind the cat. Kirchner knows to go to the door to use the restroom and is mastering leash walking quite nicely. This sweet boy doesnât even mind hanging out in the crate and rides great in the car. Kirchner would benefit from a family willing to continue his obedience training...what a fun way for him and his people to get to know one another! Kirchner is a little on the wiggly side and sometimes gets over exuberant but will settle down when asked to by his human. He would do best with older children to take him on long walks and for play time. He also wanted us to tell you he would love another dog buddy to play with! If you have a large yard, plenty of love to give and canât resist this face, please put in an application to find out all about Kirchner and help him find his forever home!"

We believe Kennedy is a border collie mix. He is robust, extremely intelligent, eager to learn new things but can be headstrong. Kennedy would do best with an experienced adopter that can offer him a structured environment and can maintain his training. Having a job to perform like agility or obedience work makes him a very happy boy! 

Kennedy would do best in a home with older children. He is heart worm negative, up to date with vaccinations, microchipped and neutered.

Nora is spayed and vaccinated. She is missing 2 toes on her left rear leg as a result of getting a string wrapped around it when she was young. They required amputation.

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

Please visit our Face book page to see the IN dogs adopted through our rescue.

Meet Rain, a 7-month-old Plott Hound mix puppy! 

Rain is actually on the smaller size coming in at just 25 lbs. (we expect her to be full grown at only 35 lbs.). She is super sweet and loves the company of other dogs. Rain is very smart and knows ALL her commands! She is also potty trained and crate trained!!! As she is just a baby, she will need a family dedicated to continuing her training.

Merlin was picked up as a stray in New York, he weighs 50 pounds and the shelter thinks he is 10 years old. There was a special sign on his run that said he was a playgroup rockstar.  When we asked the staff about him, everyone spoke up and said he was their favorite dog.  He does have some health concerns, so once he goes to the vet we will know more about his treatment, and update his listing.

She has been in a foster home for over a year, and is a charming pet who gets along with everyone in the home with  no issues.  We do want to find her a forever home, preferably with a low key environment, so that her excitement urination does not return. She would also do well with another dog to play with.  Nala is such a great dog who deserves a chance to win your heart.

I am house broken and crate trained. I do well on a leash but the more we walk the better I get. I will play ball with you and just be your best friend.

This is what Bently's foster dad has to say:

I believe Bentley will do well in any home where the owner is looking for a best friend. Bentley wants to be social and by your side at all times. He is extremely emotionally intelligent and only wants to make you happy. He loves playing and running around so having a yard for him is a HUGE plus. Bentley was almost not given another chance at life and itâs almost like he knows that. He wakes up every day looking for his next adventure. He has a perfect mix of play time and cuddles. 

Bentley has a purple toy pig that makes a pig noise. This toy is one of his FAVORITES. Whenever I pull it out, his jaw chatters because he is so excited! Bentley also has a knack for sleeping, and when heâs outâ¦ heâs out. Sometimes he snores with his mouth open and it is the cutest thing ever! He is great in the car, loves riding shotgun but also loves relaxing in the backseat on his bed! As long as he has chew toys, you will have a happy boy on your hands!

He wasnât potty trained before coming to me so he is still working on building up the time he can hold it while being inside. When in a crate he can go for a few hours no problem, but when he is out of the crate, I would suggest starting out by taking him out about every 1.5 to 2 hours. 

I have fostered a handful of dogs and Bentley is by far different than any dog Iâve had before. He loves life and wants you to love it with him. He truly is looking for a best friend to tackle life with. He is young and eager to see and experience new things!

Blitzen would be best with a family experienced in handling larger dogs. We recommend a home with older children. Blitzen seems to do well with other dogs, exhibiting a gentle curiosity, and would be best suited to a home without cats.

Exuberant, energetic, and enjoyable. That's our Daisy Mae! Daisy is full of energy and loves walking and wading through streams, or large puddles, for that matter! What a great hiking companion! Love to hike, walk, and explore? Daisy Mae is the dog for you. 

Daisy is a lot of fun, but she is very shy at first. Take her for a walk, however, and she will become your best friend.  Daisy Mae is also extremely photogenic.  We estimate Daisy Mae to be about 7 years old.  Apparently, she has a fondness for fast food and bacon strips, but she has transitioned to a healthier diet of Frommâs Salmon Tunalini and FreshPet.  

Daisy came to us when her owner died and there was no family member willing to care for her.  Neglected, her nails became so long, they curled into her pads.  Daisy Mae ended up at Philadelphia Shelter.  The folks at the shelter reached out to Sedona Shepherd and we were able to open up a spot in our foster program for Daisy Mae.

She would do best in a home without young children.  Daisy Mae ignored the cats in her foster home, but once they moved, Daisy was very interested in chasing. She does respond to commands and is quite attentive when she is comfortable with her person.  Exercise is key for Daisy Mae. She appears to be okay with other dogs, though we would recommend she be the only dog or pairing with a gentle male. Because Daisy Mae can be cautious at first with new people, we are looking for an experienced owner.  

A big thanks to Valerie Bruder Photography for Daisyâs photoshoot.

Please note:

Sedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes.  All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots

(NJ),Sayreville,NJ,08872,"Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Walker is being fostered in NJ.

What we know about Walker:
*young and loves to play
*learning manners
*housebroken
*sweet
*can see some in bright light, but has trouble in dim light

What Walker's foster mom has to say about Walker:
Walker is a solid, young dog. He is respectful of corrections, but loves to play non-stop if he can. He is a growly player. So expect him to talk back. He is learning from his foster home and four-legged family. Walker knows to go into his crate to be fed and he sleeps there too.

Walker has limited vision as he has difficulty seeing in low light.  He has totally detached retinas possibly due to some sort of trauma. He does not appear to be in pain. The vet observed the eye movement (similar to vestibular) and the âoff\"" gait he has. While exaggerated stepping is associated with the blindness, the limited correction of the paws when they fold over, and the wide spread of his body movements may be neurological.  Walker may be a little bit different but it does not slow him down.

Walker will bark and scratch a door when he wants to go out. When crated, he will bark, when loose he goes straight to the door and scratch. He will notify you when it is time to be fed and will run right into his crate and patiently wait for his bowl. He, however, does not like when another dog comes around his food. 
Walker is anxious with new situations such as getting into the car, going to the vet etc. but settles when he has time to work out what is going on.  

 Walker is not comfortable around a lot of dogs and will probably do best in a home as an only dog with owners who are not away for long hours. Heâs a doll when cuddling by himself with his person or people. Total devotion. Takes treats ever so nicely (even from the vet techs he just met), needs some leash walking help. Still tries to chew on your shoes while your feet are still in them, loves to have you try and chase him, plays tug-of-war with rope toys, totally loves his Kong with cheese and any Nylabone.
Blind Dog Rescue has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.

Our goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicantâs ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.

Phantom is a gorgeous Great Pyrenees Border Collie mix and as sweet and as smart as can be. She loves other dogs and is always ready to play. She is a wonderful mix of 2 great breeds. Phantom would be so happy to find a great home with a doggie pal or two to run around the yard with. She is pretty smart with the most beautiful markings and a shiny black and white coat. She is a curious girl and a fast learner. Phantom is currently being fostered with another dog who she takes many of her cues from...she learned housebreaking and leash walking...although she does tend to pull :)  We just love this little gal - she is a lot of fun and would be a great addition to some lucky family. Phantom enjoys leash walks and likes to explore - but she can be fearful of men and strangers so she will need a patient adopter who will work with her. She came into rescue with her sister and they are equally sweet. We cannot wait to see Phantom get a great family of her own so her new life can begin!"

Owen was found as a stray in south Jersey.  When we took him, he was very thin, his fur was in bad shape and looked neglected.  He is in foster care now and is a healthy handsome gentleman.  He does have some arthritis, but not bad, and is not a fan of crates, but otherwise is a cheerful happy pet.

Damon is a special dog who came to us last year from South Carolina to make room for Florence dogs.  He is a sweet large 65 pound dog with a fused rear leg.  We had our vet check it out.  He said he thinks that maybe as a young puppy Damon had a broken leg set for too long a time and his muscles and soft tissue atrophied so his leg is fused.  He did not recommend amputating it as Damon does use it for some support, and if removed, it might put too much strain on the other leg leading to more health issues.  If you want to rescue a super sweet special needs dog, Damon would be perfect.

Tina's issue is that,  sometime in her past, another dog or dogs weren't so nice to her and she is fearful.  Her defense is showing aggression towards other dogs.  She could successfully be walked on a leash in a park or neighborhood where there are other dogs,  and she walks very well on a leash,  but she will do best not having to closely interact with other dogs.

***Let us introduce you toâ¦ the American Shelter Dog! When we look at dogs of unknown parentage, such as this beautiful pup, the best we can do is guess at their breed, and it turns out that even dog experts are usually wrong when doing so. Itâs been shown that nearly 90 percent of shelter dogs visually identified as a particular breed/mix are mislabeled. Please understand that it is impossible to reliably identify the breed(s) or predict the behavior of dogs solely on the basis of their appearance. Though we may not know their blend, we do know that the love of a rescued dog is without boundaries and touches all those in its reach, often transforming the rescuee into the rescuer!***

This handsome lad found himself homeless after his lifetime owners ended up turning him into the shelter after they moved. This little guy ended up confused as to his whereabouts but still has a huge capacity to love.  We are unsure of his breed mix, as he is just an adorable little brown dog that looks like he could possibly have chihuahua and corgi in his ancestry.  Freddy is on the timid side, but after you gain his trust, he wants nothing more than to be by your side.  He gets along well with the dogs in his foster home, and is very respectful of their space.

Freddy has stellar house manners and knows several commands.  His foster family leaves him free in house when they are away and he is perfectly behaved.  The only thing Freddy does not like is to be picked up.  He will jump on your lap when he wants to, and he loves being petted and is very affectionate.  His fear of being held would be a non-issue if Freddy was a big dog (who wants to pick up a golden retriever or a great dane?) and just because he doesn't like to be held doesn't mean he won't snuggle with you or love you with all his heart. 

Freddy is housebroken, up to date on his vaccinations, and recently had dental work done to make his teeth sparkly clean.  He is also microchipped and neutered. He weighs in at 20lbs. Freddy is a wonderful dog that would make a great family pet.  We are recommending children 10 and over who will understand Freddy's fear of being picked up. If you are interested, we ask that you fill out an application.

Check the events page on our website for more information and directions to meet our dogs. 

To adopt Freddy Mercury, fill out our online dog application or download our Microsoft Word dog application and return it to sheltersurvivors@live.com.  It will help expedite the process.

Beautiful, gentle on the eyes, the leash, and the soul, this 4 year old girl is looking for the loving home she has never known. Lucy was a breeder dog discarded in a high kill shelter, and she was so neglected that the tips of her soft ears are completely flea bitten. Lucy is also HW positive, and needs to be spayed after she completes her HW treatments. Lucy has already started her HW treatment at our veterinarian, and desperately needs a long term (few months) foster home that can see her through her medical treatments so she will be ready for adoption to her forever home.

Lucy is incredibly sweet with everyone she meets, she is non-reactive to any dog she meets or sees while on leash, and she is a delight to meander on a walk (due to her HW, she cannot go hiking or for very long walks yet). She is a dream passenger in the car and is good being crated as well. Can you find a spot in your home to help this GENTLE SOUL? Polite, house-trained, crate trained, good in the car, non-reactive to other dogs while on leash or in public, Lucy is a true lady.

For more information about our adoption policies and to access our online application, please visit our website at www.gsgsr.org.  Please note:

UPDATE:  After taking Meimei to the vet for extensive testing, we were very sad to find out that Meimei is in Stage 3 kidney disease. This was not the prognosis that we were hoping for. Meimei will now go from being a special needs case to a hospice case. Meimei's foster family has committed to keeping her comfortable for as long as possible; Meimei will remain in their care until her journey has ended. We will continue to manage Meimei's disease with prescription food, supplements, and medication. Most of all, we will spoil Meimei with endless love, cuddles, and comfort. She's a special little girl and we are heartbroken over her diagnosis. If you are interested in donating towards Meimei's care, you can do that by going to www.sheltersurvivors.com and clicking on the \""Donate\"" button; or by going to the âHow To Helpâ page to send a donation by mail. Thank you so much for your continued support.

Meimei's story:
Meet sweet Meimei! She is a Shih Zhu mix and about 8 years old. This 12 pound girl ended up in the shelter when her owner had to move. Meimei was devastated since that was the only home she had ever known. She had been with her person since she was 8 weeks old. Not only was Meimei stressed, she also suffered from allergies and began to lose her hair. When one of our volunteers saw Meimeiâs sad little eyes and itchy skin, we knew that Meimei needed our help. After we got Meimei under our care, we found out that Meimei is showing early signs of kidney disease. We are in the process of completing extensive testing to see what stage she is in. We believe we have caught this early so we are hoping that she has many more wonderful years to be the loving and playful girl that we see everyday! The only symptoms she is showing at this point is the need to urinate more often and she can be very thirsty at times. Her appetite is great and she is active and playful! 
Although Meimeiâs world has been turned upside down, she holds no grudges. She happily greets everyone she meets (men, women, and children). She enjoys going for several walks each day, and she loves snuggling next to her people. Meimei often looks up at her foster mom with her big and round thankful eyes. This look will make your heart melt. When she falls asleep, you will hear this cute little snore. Meimei doesnât mind spending time in her crate while her foster family is at work. She greets dogs nicely and is fine living with the calm, larger dogs in her foster home.
When we picked Meimei up at the shelter, she had pink and itchy skin. We took her to the vet right away to see what was going on with her. It was determined that she has allergies that simply got out of control. Her ears were extremely infected (which we medicated); she needed medicine for her eyes; she needed allergy medicine, and a few baths a week to help soothe her skin. We noticed such a great improvement the very next day! Her hair is beginning to grow back very nicely. This will likely need to be managed for the rest of Meimeiâs life.  And now she also has the kidney disease that also will need to be managed. As long as her new owner pays attention to her medical needs, she should live a happy and fulfilling life.  While Meimei is mostly housebroken, we sometimes use a diaper when she is roaming around at home, just in case she needs to go and we don't see her signal to go out. She is able to make it through the night without a diaper. We only use the diaper if we are preoccupied and can't keep a close eye on her for that moment while we are at home. Through all of this, Meimei has allowed all handling without any problems. She is a trooper! Sheâs just so happy to be in a home and loved again.
If you think that you would like to provide Meimei the loving, caring, and stable home that she deserves, please fill out an application and come meet her at our next adoption day event!
Meimei is spayed, up to date with her shots, and microchipped.

Please Email.
NO INQUIRIES WITHOUT APPLICATION (Link Below) 

** PLEASE READ ENTIRE AD **

Need a conversation starter? Play guess the breed with this interestingly adorable canine companion. Sam weighs about 30lbs. is UTD on shots and is neutered. 

Sam would be best in a CALM home, with NO kids and get's along with dogs but can be bossy. A FULLY FENCED YARD would be best as he loves being outside and may have been an outside dog at one time. He is great in the house and sleeps all night on a dog bed (or yours). He DOES NOT LIKE A CRATE, so no crates. He likes to go for walks.

Sam does not like anyone taking away his food and tends to be food motivated so using a free-feeding method in his foster home seems to be breaking that and we would like to see that continued. He may have been abused in the past and is learning to trust again. If you have plenty of love and  patience and  love a challenge, please consider Sam. He just melts your heart when he comes for a pet or attention. 

Sam is not very social at times and begs for pets at other times. He can be strong willed and stubborn sometimes, too. In warm weather, he wants to sleep outside at night. He craves attention then wants to be left alone. You should be an experienced dog owner and understand fearful dogs. It takes time for them to trust.

This shelter survivor has totally charmed his foster mom ... she says he is super sweet, loving and affectionate. 

Dollop is loving and loyal, especially to the person who is his \""human\"". He is well behaved and content in the home, a little mellow guy who loves his walks and loves  to snuggle after his exercise. He is with other dogs right now and doing great. 

Dollop's ideal home will be one with a guardian who knows, loves and respects the bully breed. He is hesitant around new people, and does need time to warm up to strangers ... his training for that should be continued in his new home. Dog friendly, he would be fine as solo in the home too. A calmer home would be best for this low key guy. Adult only or with kids over 12. 
Dollop is house trained and crate trained.

Dollop is about five years old, weighs about 46 lbs. He is utd on vaccinations and is neutered.

Have questions? Want to arrange a visit? Please contact reboundhounds@gmail.com and we will get right back to you, thanks!

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MEETING ANNIE, PLEASE CONTACT PEGGY OVER AT POUND DOG, FOUND DOG RESCUE LOCATED IN BARNEGAT, NJ. SHE CAN BE REACHED AT PDFDrescue@hotmail.com

Minnie is going to make someone very happy! 
This 7 year old sweetheart has a wonderful demeanor and is easygoing and low maintenance. She didnât have much going for herself -  black coat, nondescript older dog who found herself in a kill shelter. Despite that, she hasnât spent one minute feeling sorry for herself.  She thrives in foster care, simply loving life. Her favorite pastime - squirrel patrol and being your sofa companion. At 18 pounds sheâs a perfect small dog size and wonât take up much room in the bed! 
Minnie would love to be an only dog so she can lap up all the attention for herself. She loves people and makes herself comfortable with them. A fenced yard would be perfect for her - we want her to be able to explore her world in safe surroundings. 
Minnie is house trained and crate trained, spayed and up to date with vaccinations. And she has just had a dental cleaning to show off her beautiful smile! Did we say she loves to take walks?  Do you? 
We love rescuing dogs like Minnie. Black dogs are so often overlooked in shelters, and 7 year olds are sometimes thought of as too old. Minnieâs only giveaway is her grey muzzle but she shows no signs of slowing down. She has years of love and companionship to give and sheâs waiting for a family to call her own. 
Please consider opening your heart to an older dog! Applications at www.pounddogfounddog.org or contact Pdfdrescue@hotmail.com for more information."

I am wonderful with all people and love to snuggle in your lap on the couch but I am very wary of other dogs/cats and am reactive on leash when I see them.

She was raised with many dogs around, but as sheâs matured her desire to have other dogs around has diminished. We are trying to find Abbey a home where she will get undivided attention and have her humans to herself.  She is a bit aloof when meeting new people but as long as people let her get to know them on her terms she settles in nicely. Sheâs extremely loving with her people, enjoys snuggling and gives gentle kisses often, but doesnât do well with active or small children. She walks extremely well on a leash, and while she gets slightly reactive when she sees other dogs during walks, she can easily be re-directed with treats and praise. Abbey is an independent player, and if given a rope-toy or a bone sheâll play all by herself for quite some timeâ¦ for some reason she plays best with these items if a person she enjoys is watching her. She loves to run, and is extremely fast, so a fenced-in yard is necessary. Being a greyhound mix, she shouldnât be with any small animals (namely cats, rodents, etc.). Sheâs very vocal, and makes strange howling sounds, but when sheâs relaxed she doesnât make a peep. She does love her crate, and will settle into it nicely. Abbey is totally vetted and ready and waiting for a single pup home.

King is a big baby who just wants to love and be loved. In August of 2016, at just 3 years old, King was abandoned by his family.  Dropped at a high kill shelter, where owner surrenders can be immediately euthanized. We couldnât let that happen to this sweet young boy.  We saw his picture, this big dopey boy snuggled up at the shelter with a smaller pittie girl and we just had to save them both (see Pennyâs story too!) 
King was unsure of his new surroundings and a little nervous when he got to his foster home.  So many new sights and sounds and smells and where was his family?  Understandably, he was confused and had a tough time settling in. We donât know much about his history but we donât think Kingâs previous âfamilyâ was very nice to him.  He came to us with some quirks that led us to believe he was probably not treated very well, possibly even abused. 
King didnât really like to be crated, he wasnât great at sharing his toys, although he likes other dogs, and he was always nervous someone was going to take his food away.  As time went on and his foster mom worked with him, he came to like his crate, although he still would prefer you not stick your fingers in there and he doesnât like to be crated if he can hear that peope are home. He wants to come out and play! And he will make his typical pittie whining sounds that donât even sound like a dog. King has gotten much better at sharing toys, although he does sometimes need to be reminded to share nicely when he gets a brand new toy. What younginâ doesnât right?  King is learning, and getting better every day, at understanding that he doesnât need to worry about anything but being a dog anymore. He will sometimes still flinch when someone raises their voice or moves quickly or raises things above his head, but he is learning that nobody will hurt him anymore. 
This silly, funny, loving boy loves to play and run and be with his people.  At bedtime he happily curls up next to his foster mom and snuggles in for the night. Heâs a big snugglebug. Sometimes he forgets that heâs 100 lbs and tries to jump into your lap for some love.  He has no idea how big and powerful he really is. He walks beautifully on a leash and is not fazed by passing cars, people, or other dogs. He loves to play fetch, have his ears scratched, and play with anyone who is willing.
King is still working on building his confidence.  In the meantime, he can occasionaly (very infrequently) be nervous around new people. However, a proper intro by his foster mom quickly quells his nerves and heâs all lovebug. Heâs simply still learning that he doesnât need to be afraid anymore, that that part of his life is over. Once he sees someone he knows, King canât wait to greet them with love and kisses and hugs.  He is still learning not to jump to greet people, he just gets so excited to see his friends! He really just loves to be loved on. 
King would do best in a home with an experienced large dog owner who can play with him regularly.  He is still young and unaware of his size and still working to forget his past so a home without small children would be best. He does like other dogs but has not been around cats, but we think he would do fine with a cat given proper introduction .  His current foster home has rabbits that King regularly play bows to and canât figure out why his foster mom wonât let him play with.  (Itâs because he doesnât realize how big he is and could accidentally hurt them, but he doesnât understand that).

She is about 3 years old and weighs 50 pounds.  She has been here for a more than a year and would love a home of her own with people that would love her for the rest of her life. She was found as a lost doggie.  She is a hound with beautiful markings.  Margo is spayed, housebroken, up to date with her vaccinations, micro-chipped, and heartworm negative.  She knows the commands of sit, stay, and lay down and walks nicely on a leash.

Margo came from a high kill shelter in Georgia where.her time was almost up.  She is a high energy dog who loves to play and run around in the yard with the other dogs.  She is wonderful with people or dogs.  We don't know how she is with cats.  She has shown no aggression since coming here and only seems to have a loving, sweet nature for anyone who comes her way.  

We think she would be fine with older children but because of her energy level may accidentally knock young children down.  Margo loves to play with her toys, including balls, tugs and hard bones; which she loves to bite on.  

Because Margo is a high energy dog a fenced yard would be a must so she would be able to run around and be safe and secure.

  CONTACT LITTLE DOG LIFEBOAT FOR MORE INFORMATION LittleDogLifeBoat@gmail.com 

  When looking for cuddling companions, two Chihuahuas are better than one! Stella and Max are twins, we think. Rescued from a person who kept them outside in the cold, they have bloomed into the loving and beloved duo they once were--happy to meet strangers, willing to snuggle up to men they just met and ready to kiss your nose in exchange for a treat. Stella is a bit blind in one eye but that doesn't slow her down. They race across the room, romping and chasing each other, sometimes ending in a wrestle on the sofa or with Stella standing on her hind legs with her paws dangling at her waist while looking around for her Max, like a prairie dog.    They are healthy, up to date with vaccines, and weewee pad trained. They weigh around five pounds- each half s lapful.    In Their ideal home, they'd be the only two dogs. They are senior citizens, hoping they won't have to share the limelight, especially Max. Cats might be ok. I'm not sure. They're a perfect pair for people with time to laugh at their playful antics and to give them the love they missed. (Please, no kids under 13) Please apply to adopt Max and Stella at Rescueridge.com and your application will be forwarded to Little Dog Lifeboat.

Marla is a 1.5 year old pit mix looking for her forever home. She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. Her foster saved her from a bad situation. When she was picked up, she had just been attacked by other dogs she was living with, had large gaping wounds and it looked like she might have had puppies recently. The vet said Marla had visible scars and this wasn't the first time she had been attacked and it was possible she had just had puppies. As sad as Marla's past is, she doesn't let it get her down!  Marla is housebroken, crate trained, sweet and absolutely loves snuggling. She is great with other dogs (she is currently living with another dog in her foster home). It is unknown how she would do with cats as her foster family doesn't have any. Marla does get a bit excited when first meeting new people and will jump, but her foster family is working on that with positive reinforcement training. Because she's a bit jumpy it would be best if she went with older kids ages 10 yrs+.  She has come such a long way since she has been living in her foster home and would do best with a  family that is active and will continue the training started by her foster family. Ideally, her forever home would have a fenced in backyard for her to run around in. Marla is one sweet bunny of a dog and will be your BFF!! Come meet/adopt her today!!

 It's hard not to smile when you see JACK smiling. Besides having a megawatt smile, this handsome ~10 year old Rottweiler Mix is an inquisitive, easy going boy that is looking for a family that won't let him down again and love and care for him like he so deserves. Jack is housebroken, cat friendly and would prefer a quiet home where he can relax and live out his golden years surrounded by a loving family. As far as dogs go, a meet will definitely need to be set up to see if it's a match.   Jack is looking for a forever or foster home - contact us at rescueridgeshelter@gmail.c om or rescueridge.com to set up a meet!

She is a very shy around men in particular, but normally warms up quickly to women. Kira can be specific with what other dogs she likes and would do best with a large male companion dog or as a single pet. Due to her high energy, she would do great with an active owner that enjoys jogging, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Kira is currently learning how to walk on a leash without pulling, and is doing well on an EZ Walk harness. She is very intelligent and open to learning and picks up very quickly. She has learned a few commands such as sit, paw, and other paw.  She is currently being trained to carry a doggie backpack filled with water bottles, and is doing great with her job. She really focusses then. 

Kira is an escape artist, and will need a secure outdoor enclosure such as a six foot fence with lean ins or an 8 foot high fence to safely contain her. She has not had much experience inside, so we are not sure how she would be as an indoor dog. Please no small pets or small dogs, Kira has a strong prey drive. 

If youâre interested in Kira, please read our adoption requirements first at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/adopt_a_wolf_adoption_requirements.html

then submit an application at; http://www.howlingwoods.org/wolf_adoption_adopt_a_wolf_application.php

He is a wonderful guy once he gets to know u. We think he was appropriately named because when you look at him, it is hard to figure out what his breed might be.  
Heinz is approximately 6 years old, 48 pounds, neutered, utd with his vaccinations, HW negative and mostly housebroken. He is so cute, a little shy, happy, friendly and loving. He also has squiggly ears that curl. His eyes have a reddish tinge to them that really compliments his beautiful, thick chestnut fur. 
Heinz loves to run around in the yard with the other dogs and seems to be awed when it snows. When he sees shadows he pounces on them. He likes toys, especially a squeaky ball and bites on hard bones. Heinz has a special ball that only he plays with.  This is his favorite thing. He knows how to sit and waits patiently for his food and treats. Heinz is a very laid back, sweet kind of guy who enjoys being petted and talked to. He would be fine with respectful older children and seems to be fine with most other dogs. Don't know how he is with cats. 
If you are looking for an exceptional dog to join your family, please consider Heinz. All he wants is to love and be loved. Heinz is so deserving of a forever home. If you think he might be a match for you, please call Judi Burns at (908) 510-8721 or send us an application which can be found on the site. Please return the application to fries3@aol.com"

As of September 30, 2017, itâs been 1064 days of shelter/kennel living for this guy.

In the time we have had Boomer we learned a lot about him. He is a smart dog that needs a job of some sort - a hiking companion, jogging buddy, or being one of the \""guys\"".   Boomer is respectful of his handler, he is healthy, strong, clean and playful. 
The fact that Boomer is part American Staffordshire Terrier makes it difficult for him and others like him. The restrictions are pretty clear: Boomer is a little too interested in cats and other dogs, so his new home should be feline and canine-free. And because heâs a young guy â about five â with lots of energy we are hoping to send him home with âa calm, experienced owner that can make his life predictable and keep him busy.\"" He needs a family with older children (teens) or just adults and no other 4 legged pets.

In an effort to find that special someone, Boomer's good behavior at the vet, in the kennel and with his handler excels.  He has the propensity for being ridiculously happy when heâs outside playing and burning his energy up. Remember a good dog is a tired dog!
And if this post seems a little more hostage-like than the more cheerful adoption promos  â well, itâs just one more effort to get one of AFEW's long-term residents his own family, at last.  âHe has waited a long time and we would love to see him finally get his forever home. As anyone who works in rescue will tell you, it is never sad when our animals go home. It is only sad when week after week they patiently wait and seem invisible to adopters and come to think of their kennel as home.â

Before he came into rescue, he was skin and bones and was due to be killed in a  kill shelter in Roanoke Falls, NC.  Since coming into rescue, he has thrived.  He is now at his normal weight and gets along well with the other dogs.  He would be fine with respectful children.  Roscoe is one of the most laid back and sweet, loving boys that we have ever had. He loves to be with people and in the yard with the other dogs and likes to bite on hard bones and other toys.  He learned how to sit quickly and waits nicely for his food and treats.

Hillary is a ~7 year old chihuahua mix rescued from a hoarding situation with 19 other chis who all lived in a pen outside with little human contact.

She is still very skittish of strangers and loud noises, but starting to get playful and enjoy being petted by the few she has bonded to.

He has gotten very comfortable in his foster home and is enjoying lounging on the couch and outside on the deck in good weather. His foster mom says he is very loving and can't wait for his daily massage and hug. He's great in the car and has no trouble meeting new people. 
Everyone who meets him falls in love with him. Fenced yard required and no other animals.

Sam is 85 lbs and about 10 yrs old--great teeth!Â Â He is a gorgeous red-tick hound that was found in Pohatcong, NJ but no one claimed him so now heâs up for adoption. Â Sam loves the water and got right into the baby pool in the yard. He loves to go for walks and gives every indication that he lived in a home where he was walked every day rather than playing in a yard--he's really not interested in running around the yard but he does like to hang out outside. In true hound fashion he loves to smell and sniff and a walk is the best place for that. Â He is a really sweet guy, walks nicely on a leash, and is good with some dogs once he knows and trusts them, but not small dogs and definitely no catsÂ Â He would be happiest and most relaxed as the only dog in the house.Â We think heâll make someone or a family a really great buddy. He's crate trained, knows \""sit\"" and is currently in a foster home in Stewartsville, NJ with Baby Girl the pitbull. He's the kind of dog that wants to do what you want him to and would really enjoy a routine so he knows what to expect. He adores his big soft bed and loves to lounge!

I have been patiently waiting for a chance to prove it to my forever family. I have had some pretty rough experiences. These are the parts of my life that I have chosen to forget, but people see them all over my body. Good fortune came my way when Eleventh Hour Rescue saved me from the streets of Jersey City. They cleaned me up and made sure I was fully recovered.

  

 I am easy to take care of with a very short coat that needs occasional brushing mostly because I love it. I don't like to walk very far, but exercise is as important for my mind as it is for my body. I like to walk for about 15 minutes. I am built for comfort not for speed. I like to play with a jolly ball and to spend time outside sniffing around. I love to sit on a bench with a kissable human. I am a little shy with new people and I don't like loud noises. I will let you know I am unhappy about it by heading back indoors.

  

 A greeting from me means hoisting my \""low to the ground\"" little body up as close as I can get and giving lots of kisses. When it is time for you to go I will head for my comfy bed and settle in with a toy and a Nylabone to chew. I learned to sleep in my crate, too. I may need a little time to get used to sleeping in a crate again after having a kennel run for a while, but I am a smart boy!

  

 Here are some obedience things I know: sit, down, stay, walking nicely on a leash with very little pulling.

  

 If you think we could be friends, even if you want to foster rather than adopt me, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org & ask for me by name - SPROCKET!"

I just love that wide muppet-style pitty grin and ears that flop over the front. This cute gal does well with submissive dogs and is an all around crowd pleaser. About 5 years old.  She is in a foster home in the Stewartsville area. Bebe would do best in a home without cats--she tends to chase them but wouldn't hurt them and she would be too much for small kids, so older kids, 12 and up only. She's housetrained and very well rate trained. She's already spayed and up to date on shots, on heartworm prevention and microchipped--ready to go!

Please note that the pups that you see in these pictures have been adopted. However we regularly rescue pups like these from India who are available for adoption in the US. We are looking for fosters or volunteers in New Jersey for our IN pups/dogs rescued from the streets of India. We need committed foster homes for our pups who will take care of them when they are in the U.S. till a forever home is found. We are also looking for volunteers who is willing to fly with the dogs. It is extremely expensive to fly the dogs solo from India to the U.S; however it is lot cheaper if you are flying with the dogs. If you are visiting Delhi (where we have foster homes) or surrounding cities in India and would like to help us rescue a pup or two from the streets by flying them with you back home to the U.S. please contact us.

We are very proud to be a Rescue without borders. So, what does it mean to be a rescue without borders? In the last 18 months we were able to rescue, rehabilitate and find homes for over 90 IN dogs in the U.S. and Canada. We rescue and adopt within the U.S. irrespective of state borders, but now you may be wondering, why India? Typically in India, dogs that are born on the streets are not kept as family pets. Most people cannot afford to keep a dog as a pet and those who do prefer a western breed as a status symbol. So these street dogs spend their entire lives on the streets in deplorable conditions. Most of the pups that are born on the streets will get killed by passing cars, or die of starvation or malnutrition. These dogs/ pups often become victims of cruelty as some people resort to cruel measures to get rid of them from their streets. The average life span of a dog living on the streets of India is 3 years during which time they continue to live starving miserable life full of abuse and suffering; however when these same dogs when given a chance to live in a home as family pets will live a healthy life of up to 16-18 years. That is why we rescue these dogs to give them an opportunity to be a part of a family and to live their life in a comfort and safety of a loving home.

More Info on this breed --- Desi (Local) or IN (Indian Native) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, and thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domestic dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog. 
This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and is how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness. 
They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run. 
INDogs dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.  These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs. 
Desi dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.  A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 16 years. This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weight about 28-50 pounds (12 â 22 kgs). With pointed ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back, an IN Dog is similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian dingo.

These are the real rescues- the ones that don't do well in shelters and that most adopters would pass by. At Second Chance we understand these dogs and look forward to the opportunity to give them a \""second chance\"".
We call them our \""feral dogs\""- dogs who for one reason or another were never properly socialized and do not know how to bond with people. Some are  just  extremely \""shy\"" dogs who are nervous around strangers but bond in a few days and act normal with their owner but have social issues meeting new people. Others have probably never been touched or had any positive experience with people and will hide or run away given the opportunity.  The ones we have are generally not aggressive- they just hide or freeze in fear when approached. Some may come around with their owners after months/years while others may always remain somewhat fearful even with people they live with. Whether they have been rescued from puppy mills, hoarding situations, or were just undersocialized strays, the one thing they all have in common is that they LOVE other dogs and will bond readily to them. Observing a friendly social dog interacting with people speeds up their rehabilitation and they will often start to approach their owner when they see the other dog getting attention. Their ideal home would be a calm adult household willing to give them time to adjust, and accept them even if they never bond fully to people.  They require owners who will be vigilant in making sure they are not able to bolt out a door or escape, as they will not approach people to allow themselves to be caught once they get loose.  While these special needs dogs are not for everyone and need very special people, those who do open their hearts to these types of dogs report that helping to rehabilitate them is such a rewarding experience.  We have several shy dogs up for adoption right now:
Waffle is a 2 year old chihuahua mix rescued from a hoarding case where over 100 dogs were living in a studio apartment in horrific conditions!Â  She is very timid at first and especially scared of men, but once she bonds she is a cuddly playful girl with her owner.Â 
Â 

Jupiter and Jambalaya are young chihuahua/pom/doxie??? mixes from a horrible hoarding situation.Â  They are all very timid but sweet girls and want to make friends, and love other dogs.

Katie, a ~2 year old yellow lab mix, lived on the streets for at least a year with a pack of dogs before finally being caught by animal control.Â  She was terrified at first of people, but has quickly bonded to her foster mom and come out of her shell around other people too!Â  She LOVES to play with other dogs and they love her too- she can get almost anyone to play with her!Â 
Â 
Vera and Veronica are stunning 1 year old husky/collie mixes who lived outside in a yard in a local city and were never handled.  They are spunky and playful with other dogs but still haven't quite gotten used to being handled or learned to bond to humans.  
Uggie is a young bichon mix rescued from life in a puppy mill.  He loves to play with his doggie friends but is still getting used to be touched by humans.
JoJo is a young chi/pom who bonds quickly to one person but is very timid with others.   Once he bonds he loves to be held and is a cute playful pup.
We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East next to 5 Star Car Wash (formerly Boulder Car Wash) in Morris Plains (Denville on GPS).  To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions.

She weighs 30 pounds and is 13 years old. She's up to date on vaccinations, spayed, heartworm negative (on preventative) and microchipped. She's crate trained and housetrained too.

Bambi is a friendly and energetic former hunting dog who is happy to have been given a chance to start a new life. She likes people and gets along with the dogs in her foster home. She is nervous around dogs she doesn't know and is NOT good with cats so a home without kitties or other small pets is a MUST. Bambi is an independent dog who would quite happily spend all day lounging on the couch. She LOVES to be outside but must have a securely fenced yard (not \""invisible\"" or underground fencing) that is at least 5ft high to safely contain her. She enjoys going for walks, but becomes anxious when unfamiliar dogs approach. Bambi is looking for a dog savvy home with prior hound experience to love her. She is a great dog with a nice disposition that is patiently waiting to meet that special someone who will love and spoil her.  Could it be you?

She is current on vaccinations, on flea/tick and heartworm preventative, spayed and microchipped.   

She's a very affectionate, happy little Beagle that loves people and greets everyone she meets with wiggles and wags! She gets along with other small dogs, but so far hasn't been exposed to cats so we don't know how well she'd do sharing a home with a feline.  

Lizzie is a typical Beagle who enjoys exploring the backyard of her foster home. She definitely has the Beagle nose and is quick to pick up a scent. For her safety, she needs the security of a \""Beagle-proof\"" fenced-in yard if she is going to be allowed off leash. 

Lizzie loves to go for leisurely walks and makes the cutest little snorty noise as she snuffles along with her nose to the ground. She's crate trained but needs go outside to \""potty\"" several times during the day. She currently takes medication to help prevent accidents. She has some trouble navigating stairs so a home that is on one level would be best.

Lizzie is a delightful little Beagle that will make a wonderful companion for someone looking for a gentle, older dog.

He came to our rescue from a high kill shelter and was saved from being euthanized. He is a small dog and weighs about 18 pounds. Dexter looks more like a Dachshund, but has longer legs. He is current on vaccinations, neutered, on monthly flea/tick and preventative, and microchipped.Â 

Dexter is playful and affectionate with people he knows and trusts, but he is very fearful of strangers, particularly men. He can be very reactive when he sees people or other dogs he doesn't know while out on a walk. If he feels threatened he gets defensive. However, if allowed to meet new people on his own terms he is much more accepting. He probably didn't receive much socialization as a young dog and as a result is fearful of strangers - both human and canine. We feel he would do best as the only pet in the home.Â 

Dexter will need an experienced adopter that understands his special needs and is willing to continue working on socializing him while providing a stable environment. An adult-only home would be ideal. Prior experience with Dachshunds or Chihuahuas and their temperaments is preferred. 

He's an affectionate and playful dog that will require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation to give him positive outlets for all his energy. Being home alone in a crate all day would NOT be a suitable environment for Dexter. He is crate trained but needs frequent opportunities to go outside to potty during the day, although he is fine in his crate overnight.  Dexter is a very sweet boy that would be a very loyal and lovable companion for the right person.

He has proved to be very loving and sweet. He is also very strong but walks well with a training collar by your side. He is utd with his vaccinations, is neutered, housebroken, microchipped, 65 pounds, and is crate trained; but has free roam of the house at this time.  Blue loves to play with his toys and will bring them to you to play. Blue also loves to bite on hard bones. He is a big, sweet mush. He would be fine in a home with older respectful children. We don't know how he is with cats but think he would be best in a home without them.
He is a very unusual looking guy - not only because of his blue-gray coat but also because of his pretty eyes and freckled face. He also gives puppy kisses and loves tummy rubs. Blue loves any attention that comes his way and likes to be petted and hugged. He is looking for a family who will love and spend time with him and teach him all the things he needs to learn. He is a quick learner and is like a sponge. He learned to sit in a day. He also knows the commands of stay, down, paw, speak, and we are currently working on rolling over.
If you think you might be able to give Baby Blue the love and caring forever home that he so deserves please call Judi Burns at (908) 510-8721 or send e-mail to fries3@aol.com"

He is a small dog about 11 yrs. old, and weighs 20 pounds. Maverick is current on vaccinations, neutered, on heartworm and flea/tick preventative, and microchipped. He is crate trained too.

Maverick is initially shy and fearful when he meets new people but is becoming more and more comfortable with each positive encounter. He's also fearful of other dogs and tends to go on the offense (barking and lunging) making introductions difficult. He would do best being the only dog in the home. We have not observed him with cats, but he does have a strong desire to chase anything that runs, so a home without cats is recommended.

He is an affectionate dog with lots of love to give to that special someone. The ideal adopter will be willing and able to invest the time needed to help Maverick overcome his fears and help build his confidence through positive training methods. An adult-only home would probably be best. 

Maverick is \""cute as a button\"" in his own special way. He just loves to play! He is energetic and enjoys daily exercise such as long walks or outdoor playtime. A home with a securely fenced yard (not \""invisible\"" or underground fencing) is a must if he is going to be off leash. He is used to daily long walks and is generally well-behaved on the leash. 

Maverick is a great little dog that is looking for a special friend to help him be all that he can be. Could it be you?

She is approximately 10 years old and weighs just 20 pounds. Miley is current on vaccinations, already spayed, heartworm neg. (on preventative), and microchipped. She is crate trained too.  Though she is very shy with strangers (and the camera), Miley is a super affectionate dog that enjoys attention and loves being fussed over and spoiled by people she trusts. She really likes to snuggle and enjoys lots of one-on-one time with her favorite people. 

She is afraid of and reactive toward dogs she doesn't know. As a result, she doesn't handle introductions very well. She would prefer to be an only dog so she wouldn't have to share her human's attention and could get all the lovin' she deserves. Miley has not been observed with cats so a home without kitties is recommended.

Miley is a sweet little girl that really likes being with the people she trusts and enjoys being pampered. She'd be a wonderful companion for an experienced adopter/dog owner that understood her needs.
